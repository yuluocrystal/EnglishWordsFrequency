Section II Reading Comprehension
Part A 
Text 1 
In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of consumption” launched by the 19th--century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite.” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization. 
Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented level nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent .In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation Clanguage, home ownership and intermarriage. 
The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreignCborn immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans. 
Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S Cborn whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of AsianCAmerican women are married to non-Asians. 
Rodriguez note that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrant living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.” 
Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social induces suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment. 

21.The word “homogenizing” (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means 
[A] identifying 
[B] associating 
[C] assimilating 
[D] monopolizing 

22. According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century 
[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture. 
[B] became intimate shops for common consumers. 
[C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite. 
[D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption 

23.The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. 
[A] are resistant to homogenization. 
[B] exert a great influence on American culture. 
[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture. 
[D] constitute the majority of the population. 

24. Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5? 
[A] To prove their popularity around the world. 
[B] To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants. 
[C] To give examples of successful immigrants. 
[D] To show the powerful influence of American culture. 

25.In the author’s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is 
[A] rewarding. 
[B] successful. 
[C] fruitless. 
[D] harmful. 
Text 2 
Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry-William Shakespeare-but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other sights. 
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise - making. 
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus- and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side C don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight - seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall. 
The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive. 
Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low. 
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) Clean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m. 
26. From the first two paras , we learn that 
A. the townsfolk deny the RSC ’ s contribution to the town’s revenue 
B. the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage 
C. the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms 
D. the townsfolk earn little from tourism 
27. It can be inferred from Para 3 that 

A. the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately 
B. the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers 
C. the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers 
D. the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater 

28. By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies that 
A. Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects 
B. Stratford has long been in financial difficulties 
C. the town is not really short of money 
D. the townsfolk used to be poorly paid 

29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because 
A. ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending 
B. the company is financially ill-managed 
C. the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable 
D. the theatre attendance is on the rise 
 
30. From the text we can conclude that the author 
A. is supportive of both sides 
B. favors the townsfolk’s view 
C. takes a detached attitude 
D. is sympathetic
Text 3 
When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived, the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. 
Now something similar could be happening in the oceans that the seas are being over-fished has been known for years what researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods de not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative, one reason for this is that fishing technology has improved Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago that means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since to baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. 
Dr. Myers and Dr. worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline”. The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to de business. 
31、The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that 
A、 large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment 
B、 small species survived as large animals disappeared 
C、 large sea animals may face the same threat today. 
D、 Slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones 

32、who can infer form Dr Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper that 
A、 the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90% 
B、 there are only half as many fisheries are there were 15 years ago 
C、 the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount 
D、 the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisherish than in the old 

33、By saying these figures are conservative (line in ,paragragf-3), Dr worm means that 
A、 fishing technology has improved rapidly 
B、 then catch-sizes are actually smaller then recorded 
C、 the marine bio mass has suffered a greater loss 
D、 the date collected so far are pit pf date. 

34 、Dr Myers and other researchers hold that 
A、people should look for a baseline that can’t work for a longer time 
B、fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass 
C、the ocean biomass should restored its original level. 
D、people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situation. 

35、The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries’ 
A、 management efficiency 
B、 biomass level 
C、 catch-size limits 
D、 technological application. 
Text 4 
Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists' only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad. 
This wasn't always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth's daffodils to Baudelaire's flowers of evil. 
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen such misery. But it's not as if earlier times didn't know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today. 
After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology. 
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too. 
Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy .Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks. 
What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air. 

36.By citing the example of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show that 
A. Poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music. 
B. Art grow out of both positive and negative feeling. 
C. Poets today are less skeptical of happiness. 
D. Artist have changed their focus of interest. 
37. The word “bummer” (Line 5. paragraph 5) most probably means something 
A. religious B. unpleasant C. entertaining D. commercial 
38.In the author’s opinion, advertising 
A. emerges in the wake of the anti-happy part. 
B. is a cause of disappointment for the general peer 
C. replace the church as a major source of information 
D. creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself. 
39.We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes 
A .Happiness more often than not ends in sadness. 
B. The anti-happy art is distasteful by refreshing. 
C. Misery should be enjoyed rather than denied. 
D .The anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms 
40.Which of the following is true of the text? 
A Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery. 
B Art provides a balance between expectation and reality. 
C People feel disappointed at the realities of morality. 
D mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths. 
Part B 
On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville,Ind, home of David Willianis ,52,and of a riverboat casinola place where gambling games are played .During several years of gambling in that casino ,Williams a state auditor earning $35,000 a year ,last approximately $175,000 . He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 worth of gambling. 
He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left .On his second visit he lost $800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a “Fun Card”, which when used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user’s gambling activities. For Williams, these activities become what he calls “electronic heroin”. 
(41) ,In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In march 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat locked at 5 a.m , then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m .Now he is suing the casino ,charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a problem. 
In march 1998,a friend of Williams’s got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams’s gamblers. The casinno included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote to him a” cease admissions” letter noting the “medical /psychological” nature of problem gambling behaviors, the letter said that before being readmitted to the patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his safety or well-being. 
(42) 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 20 signs warning,“enjoy the fun and always bet with your head ,not over it .”Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health .Nevertheless Williams’s suit charged that the casino ,knowing he was “helplessly addicted to gambling”intentionally worked to “love” him to “engage in conduct against his will” well. 
(43) 
The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental Disorders says “pathological gambling ”involves president, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit loss of money than of the thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall. 
(44) , .Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders skin to physical disabilities 
(45) 
Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying degrees dependent on__you might say addicted to__revenues from wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site was created in 1995,competition for gambler’s dollars has become intense. The Oct.28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 1,800 virtual cosines every week, with $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this year, gambling has ,passed pornography as the web’s webs most profitable business. 

(A). Although no such evidence was preserved, the casino’s marketing department continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino ad used his Fun Card without being detected. (B) It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. And in what sense was his will operative? 
(C) By the time he had lost $5,00, he said to himself that if he could get back to even , he would quit , one night he won $5,500 ,but he did not quit. 
(D) Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease . Now it is a social policy , the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government . 
(E) David Williamds suit should trouble this gambling nation . But don’t bet on it . 
(F) It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems , often defining as addiction what earlier ,sterner generations explained as weakness of will. 
(G) the anoymous ,lonely ,undistracted nature of online gambling is especaillly conductive to compulsive behavior . But even if the government knew how to more against Internet gambling , what would be its grounds for doing so? 
Part C 
Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckbergen told part of the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected American. But they have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It is they, not American, who have become anti-intellectual. 
First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? (46) I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in Socratic(苏格拉底) way about moral problems. He explores such problem consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained. (47) His function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a matter as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision. 
This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as intellectuals----the average scientist for one. 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral issues even in everyday performance of his routine duties--- he is not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) But his primary task is not to think about the moral code, which governs his activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most of his walking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics. 
The definition also excludes the majority of factors, despite the fact that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living (50) They may teach very well , and more than earn their salaries ,but most of them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description even fits the majority eminent scholars. “Being learned in some branch of human knowledge in one thing, living in public and industrious thoughts”, as Emersion would say, “is something else.”

参考答案
文章背景
　　本文主要介绍了美国社会中的无家可归者，以及他们目前的现状：他们的数量已经增长至地方政府对付不了的地步，需要联邦政府采取措施帮助他们重新获得自立。但是，许多无家可归者即使在解决温饱之后仍然游荡街头，这是因为他们要么酗酒或吸毒成瘾，要么患严重的精神疾病，要么就是缺乏能够改变生活现状的生存技能。因此，要想从根本上帮助这些无家可归者，必须采取综合的彼此协调的一揽子措施。
　　文章结构
　　本文采用了总分的叙述方式，第一段提出了文章的主题"无家可归者的人数在增加，政府必须采取措施来解决这一问题"。第二段和第三段作者分别从这两个方面进行了论述，第二段提出无家可归者的人数在未来还会进一步增加;第三段提出了解决这一问题的方法。
　　答案详解
　　1. 【解析】[A] 语义衔接/逻辑衔接。The homeless make up a growing percentage of America's population., homelessness has reached such proportions that…。"无家可归者在美国人口中占越来越大的比例。……无家可归者所占的比例已经达到如此地步，以至于……。" 选项A. indeed表示强调;B. likewise与……相似;C. therefore因此(强调结果);D. furthermore进一步说(表示递进)。根据前一句"make up a growing percentage"与后一句"reach such proportion that"确定后者是对前者的例证强调。因此，正确答案为A。
　　2.【解析】[B] 语义衔接题。本题目选择动词在定语从句中充当谓语。…homelessness has reached such proportions that local government can't possibly. "无家可归者所占的比例已经达到地方政府都无法……的地步。"选项A. stand 忍受;B. cope (成功地)对付，应对;C. approve 赞成，批准;D. retain 保留。stand作为及物动词在句子中要直接连接宾语，但是句子中没有宾语，因此该词不符合句子结构; cope作为不及物动词，可以在句子中表达完整的含义;C、D项与句意不符。因此，正确答案为B。
　　3.【解析】[D] 语义衔接题。本题目选择介词，选择介词与句子中的动词有直接关系。原文意为：帮助无家可归者达到独立。D项toward意为"达成，意在达到，以……为目标"。C项with可与help构成搭配to help sb. with sth."帮助某人做某事"，与题意不符。因此，正确答案为D。
　　4.【解析】[A] 语义衔接题。the federal government must support job training programs,the minimum wage, and fund more lowcost housing. "联邦政府必须提供就业培训项目,……最低工资标准，资助建设更多低价住房。" 句子中"the minimum wage"与前面的短语"support job training program"(提供就业培训项目)和后面的短语"fund more lowcost housing"(资助建设更多低价住房)是并列关系。由提供信息确定选择"提高"之意。raise增加，提高，"提高最低工资标准"，符合句子含义; add也意为"增加"，但它的宾语一般是具体数字。因此，正确答案为A。
　　5.【解析】[D] 语义衔接/词汇辨析题。本题目选择副词，在句子中限定范围。everyone agrees on the numbers of Americans who are homeless. "……每个人同意美国无家可归者的数量。" 由于本题包含反义选项，而上文又没有提示，因此应看下面句中的信息。第6题所在的语境句意为"人们对此的估计数字从六十万到三百万不等"。因此，本题意思应该为"关于美国无家可归者的数量，众说不一"。A、B两项表示肯定含义，所以排除。C、D项同样表示否定含义，但hardly一般与anyone，anything搭配;not 与all, every搭配表示部分否定。
　　6.【解析】[C] 语义衔接/惯用衔接题。句子中的主语、宾语以及介词决定所选择的动词。句子叙述到Estimatesanywhere from 600,000 to 3 million. "估计数字……60万到300万之间。" 选项A. cover覆盖，包括;B. change改变，变化;C. range在某范围中变化;D. differ不同。句子中选择的动词要与 "from 600,000 to 3 million" 构成搭配，句子提供信息确定选择"在……范围波动"之意。选项A. cover覆盖，包括，与要表达的句意不符;B项change from…to…意为"由……变为……",此处不表示变化的意思，故排除。D项differ可与from搭配，表示 "不同于……"。因此，C为正确选项。
　　7.【解析】[B] 逻辑衔接题。the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter… "……(人们估计的)数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的。" 选项 A. now that既然;B. although虽然……;C. provided 假设……;D. except 除去……。根据本题所在的语境，前文中的may vary与后文中的do agree互为反义，确定二者为转折让步关系。因此，正确答案为B，句子译为"虽然(人们估计的)数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的"。
　　8.【解析】[C] 语义衔接/词汇辨析题。Although the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter: that the number of the homeless is. "虽然(人们估计的)数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的：无家可归者的人数正在……。"选项A. inflating 膨胀;B. expanding发展，扩张(面积或体积方面变大，扩张);C. increasing增加;D. extending延伸(在长度上的延伸)。文章首句便提到 "无家可归者在美国人口中所占的比例越来越大(growing percentage)", 本空格要与growing构成呼应，应该填入increasing。因此，正确答案为C。

　　15.【解析】[C] 语义衔接/词汇辨析题。simply lack the everydayskills needed to turn their lives. "就是缺乏让自己生活变……的……技巧"。选项A. life生活，生命;B. existence存在;C. survival生存，存活;D. maintenance维护，维持。英语中"生活/生存技能"的固定搭配是survival skills, 因此，正确答案为C。maintenance skills意思是"维修技术，保养技术"。

　　18.【解析】[C] 逻辑衔接/惯用衔接题。director of community service at Bentley College in Massachusetts, 是Edward Zlotkowski 这个人物的同位语成分，这样就更容易看出句子结构了：as sb. puts it "正如某人说的那样……"，put此处意为"表达"。因此，正确答案为C。
