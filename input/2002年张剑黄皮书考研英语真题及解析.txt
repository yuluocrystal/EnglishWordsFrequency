Comparisons were drawn between the development of television in the 20th century and the diffusion of printing in the 15th and 16th centuries. Yet much had happened   1   . As was discussed before, it was not   2   the 19th century that the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic_ 3 _  ，following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in the   4   of the periodical. It was during the same time that the communications revolution  5    up, beginning with transport, the railway, and leading   6   through the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and motion pictures  7  the 20th century world of the motor car and the air plane. Not everyone sees that Process in    8   . It is important to do so. 
It is generally recognized,  9   , that the introduction of the computer in the early 20th century,   10   by the invention of the integrated circuit during the 1960s, radically changed the process,   11   its impact on the media was not immediately   12   . As time went by, computers became smaller and more powerful, and they became “personal” too, as well as   13   , with display becoming sharper and storage   14    increasing. They were thought of, like people,   15   generations, with the distance between generations much   16   . 
It was within the computer age that the term “information society” began to be widely used to describe the   17   within which we now live. The communications revolution has   18   both work and leisure and how we think and feel both about place and time, but there have been  19   view about its economic, political, social and cultural implications. “Benefits” have been weighed    20   “harmful” outcomes. And generalizations have proved difficult.

Text 1

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view.  Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.
Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?” the new arrival asked St. Peter.  “Oh, that’s God,” came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor.” 
If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman.  You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system. 
If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark. 
Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first you don’t succeed, give up” or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and understatement. Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences which you can turn about and inject with humor.

21. To make your humor work, you should      .
[A] take advantage of different kinds of audience
[B] make fun of the disorganized people
[C] address different problems to different people
[D] show sympathy for your listeners
22. The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they are     .
[A] impolite to new arrivals
[B] very conscious of their godlike role
[C] entitled to some privileges
[D] very busy even during lunch hours
23. It can be inferred from the text that public services     .
[A] have benefited many people
[B] are the focus of public attention
[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor
[D] have often been the laughing stock
24. To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be delivered     .
[A] in well-worded language
[B] as awkwardly as possible
[C] in exaggerated statements
[D] as casually as possible
25. The best title for the text may be     .
[A] Use Humor Effectively
[B] Various Kinds of Humor
[C] Add Humor to Speech
[D] Different Humor Strategies

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in robotics―the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.
As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy―far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.
But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves―goals that pose a real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error," says Dave Lavery, manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can't yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to reliably interact with a dynamic world.” 
Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries. 
What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain's roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented―and human perception far more complicated―than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can't approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it. 

26. Human ingenuity was initially demonstrated in    .
[A] the use of machines to produce science fiction.
[B] the wide use of machines in manufacturing industry.
[C] the invention of tools for difficult and dangerous work.
[D] the elite’s cunning tackling of dangerous and boring work.
27. The word “gizmos” (line 1, paragraph 2) most probably means   .   
[A] programsぃB］ experts     ［C］ devices    ［D］ creatures
28. According to the text, what is beyond man's ability now is to design a robot that can  . 
[A] fulfill delicate tasks like performing brain surgery.
[B] interact with human beings verbally.   
[C] have a little common sense.  
[D] respond independently to a changing world.
29. Besides reducing human labor, robots can also   .   
[A] make a few decisions for themselves.
[B] deal with some errors with human intervention.   
[C] improve factory environments.
[D] cultivate human creativity.
30. The author uses the example of a monkey to argue that robots are   .
[A] expected to copy human brain in internal structure.
[B] able to perceive abnormalities immediately.   
[C] far less able than human brain in focusing on relevant information.
[D] best used in a controlled environment.

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-1980, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?
The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports. Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term.
Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the past.
Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies―to which heavy industry has shifted―have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed. 
One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%. 

31. The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is_______
[A] global inflation.             [B] reduction in supply. 
[C]fast growth in economy.        [D] Iraq’s suspension of exports.  
32. It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up dramatically if______.   
[A] price of crude rises.            [B] commodity prices rise.
[C] consumption rises.               [D] oil taxes rise.
33. The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries_______.   
［A］heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive.   
［B］income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices.   
［C］manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed.   
［D］oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP.
34. We can draw a conclusion from the text that_______.
［A］oil-price shocks are less shocking now.   
［B］inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks.   
［C］energy conservation can keep down the oil prices.   
［D］the price rise of crude leads to the shrinking of heavy industry.
35. From the text we can see that the writer seems__________.
［A］optimistic.   ［B］sensitive.   ［C］gloomy.  ［D］scared.

Text 4

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering. 
Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect”, a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects―a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen―is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect. 
Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to control terminally ill patients’pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the patient. 
Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient medication to control their pain if that might hasten death”. 
George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery,” he says. “We don’t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide.”
On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying. 
Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying” as the twin problems of end-of-life care.
The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life. 
Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering”, to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse”. He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear...that painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension”. 

36. From the first three paragraphs, we learn that       .
[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients’pain
[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives
[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide
[D] patients have no constitutional right to commit suicide
37. Which of the following statements its true according to the text?
[A] Doctors will be held guilty if they risk their patients’death.
[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.
[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.
[D] A doctor’s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.
38. According to the NAS’s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is     .
[A] prolonged medical procedures          [B] inadequate treatment of pain
[C] systematic drug abuse                [D] insufficient hospital care
39. Which of the following best defines the word “aggressive” (line 4, paragraph 7)?
[A] Bold.     [B] Harmful.      [C] Careless.    [D] Desperate
40. George Annas would probably agree that doctors should be punished if they      .
[A] manage their patients incompetently
[B] give patients more medicine than needed
[C] reduce drug dosages for their patients
[D] prolong the needless suffering of the patients

Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of behavior, but we have been slow to develop the science from which such a technology might be drawn.（41）One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on. Physics and biology once followed similar practices and advanced only when they discarded them. （42）The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find. The environment is obviously important, but its role has remained obscure. It does not push or pull, it selects, and this function is difficult to discover and analyze.（43）The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied. As the interaction between organism and environment has come to be understood, however, effects once assigned to states of mind, feelings, and traits are beginning to be traced to accessible conditions, and a technology of behavior may therefore become available. It will not solve our problems, however, until it replaces traditional prescientific views, and these are strongly entrenched. Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty. （44）They are the possessions of the autonomous（self-governing）man of traditional theory, and they are essential to practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements. A scientific analysis shifts both the responsibility and the achievement to the environment. It also raises questions concerning “values”. Who will use a technology and to what ends? （45）Until these issues are resolved, a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our problems.

第一部分  英语知识应用试题解析


一、文章总体分析
本文主要介绍了计算机的发展对通信革命及人们的生存方式产生的影响。文章第一段从早期的通信革命入手，指出在15、16世纪和20世纪之间发生了很多事情，特别是通信革命加快了步伐。第二段接着提到20世纪计算机的出现极大地改变了这一进程。第三段指出随着计算机的发展，我们步入了一个信息社会。在计算机影响下，通信革命改变了我们的工作和休闲方式，也影响了我们的思考和感知方式。在结尾部分，文章提到，当然，关于这种通信革命在经济、政治、社会和文化各方面的影响是利大于弊还是弊大于利，还存在争议。

二、试题具体解析
1.  [A] between在…当中，在空间、位置或时间的中间
[B] before在此之前早些时候，在…前面
[C] since自从…以后，以前
[D] later 后来，稍后，随后
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：时间副词的用法辨析。
解此题关键看两个方面，一是理解文章第一句话的含义：人们曾对20世纪电视的发展以及15世纪和16世纪印刷术的传播进行了比较。二是注意转折连词yet的用法，yet一般标志着接下来的内容与前面的内容出现了较大的不同，如：She said she would be late, yet she arrived on time.（她说她会迟到，但她却准时到达了）。文中第二句话结构非常简单，主语和谓语都无法体现与第一句话的强烈对照，这时只能通过空格里填入的时间状语来体现了，因此这个时间副词应与第一句话中的时间状语in the 20th century和 in the 15th and 16th centuries相呼应并对照。接下来关键看这个时间副词表示的是哪个时间段，15、16世纪之前，20世纪之后还是两者之间。其实我们从下文中的the 19th century也可以推断出正确答案是between，即“然而，在这两个时段之间却发生了很多事情”。
2.  [A] after          [B] by       [C] during        [D] until 
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：固定句型。
空格所在的句子是一个强调句型：it was + 时间状语 + that。四个选项中能与not搭配的只有until，not until表示“直到……才……”，整个句意是“直到十九世纪，报纸才成为电子时代到来前主要的……”。如：It was not until the afternoon that he begun to tackle the problem.（直到下午他才开始解决问题）。
知识点补充：在这种强调状语的结构中，表示状语的成分可以是单词、词组或句子。强调句子时可以是主语从句、宾语从句或状语从句。如：It was at an evening party that I first met her.（强调地点状语）；It was because the water had risen that they could not cross the river.（强调原因状语从句，引导词只能用because，不能用since，as或why）；It is what you will do that is essential.（强调主语从句）。
3.  [A] means方式，方法，手段              [B] method方法
[C] medium（表达或传播的）媒介          [D] measure措施，步骤，方法
  [答案] C
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：名词词义辨析。
本题相关部分是the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic_  3  _, following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book，其中in the wake of 意为“紧跟…之后，接踵而来”，如：Outbreaks of disease occurred in the wake of the drought.（那场旱灾过后，疾病肆虐）。因此整个句子的含义是“报纸继宣传册和书之后成为电子时代到来前主要的__ 3_  _”从句意来看，空格处填入的名词应概括newspaper、pamphlet和book的共同特点，根据常识，报纸、宣传册和图书都只能是传播信息的媒介（medium），而不是方法或措施。Medium可特指“大众传播手段，包括报纸、杂志、广播或电视等”，如：Commercial television is a medium for advertising.（商业电视是一种广告媒介）。
词汇补充：注意means和medium都可以表示借以成就某事或达到某目的人或物。means (单复数同形)可以指人或物，其含义为“手段”或“工具”。这个词不仅用于具体的东西，也可以用于抽象的意念。如：Thoughts of one individual could be communicated to another by means of speech（一个人的思想能够借助于语言传递给另一个人）；medium 的含义是“媒介，手段”，通过它能完成、传输或转移某种事物的东西：如：Air is a medium of sound.（空气是声音传播的媒体）。
method 所表示的“方法”可以指做某件事的具体步骤或程序，也可以指抽象概念“条理”，如：To do this, scientists have to devise methods using radar and underwater television.（为此，科学家还要设计出使用雷达和水下电视的方法）；measures表示“手段，策略，为达到目的采取的行动，权宜之计”，如：They took strong measures against dangerous drivers.（他们对危害公众的司机采取强硬的措施）。
4.  [A] (in the) process (of) 在……过程中
[B] (in the) company (of) 在……陪伴下，与……同时出现
[C] (in the) light (of) 按照，根据
[D] (in the) form (of) 以……的形式
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义 + 介词短语辨析。
文章相关部分是newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic medium, following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in the   4   of the periodical，从结构上来看，现在分词结构following in the wake of 和介词短语in the   4   of 是并列成分，都做主句的伴随状语，newspaper，pamphlet and book，periodical也是三个平行的部分，它们之间的关系是通过in the wake of和in the   4   of两个部分来体现的。分词结构following in the wake of…意为“随着宣传册和书的出现以后”，体现了时间上的先后。因此空格处的动词构成的短语应既需要与分词结构表并列含义，又需要体现newspaper和periodical之间的时间关系。四个选项从意义上来看，只有B符合。
5.  [A] gathered (up) 收集，蜷缩，概括      
[B] speeded (up) 加速
[C] worked (up) 逐步建立，逐步发展，逐步引起，整理 
[D] picked (up) 拾起，染上，学到，整理，收听到，好转
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：动词短语辨析。
本题要求考生判断哪个动词可以与up搭配，构成短语动词，且符合文意。该动作的发出者是前面的主语communication revolution。根据语义，恰当选项是speeded up，表示“通信革命加速发展”。文中所在句子用了强调结构It was during the same time that，强调时间状语19世纪，表明在这一时期不但报纸成为主要媒介，而且通信革命也取得了重大的成果：运输业、铁路、电报、电话、无线电、电影都在发展。
知识点补充：与up搭配组成的短语动词还包括：beat up（毒打），choke up（说不出话），dress up（盛装），end up（结束），hold up（阻止，妨碍），mix up（混淆），play up（强调），sign up（签约），take up（从事），wash up（洗餐具）等。
例句补充：The child gathered up his toys and put them away.（孩子把他的玩具收拾起来放好）；I worked up this business from nothing.（我在一无所有的情况下把这个事业逐步发展起来的，或，我白手起家）；Trade has been slack for the past six months, but it is now picking up.（过去六个月里商业一直很萧条，但现在情况正在好转）。
6.  [A] (lead) on引导，率领……继续前进
    [B] (lead) out开始，领舞伴起舞
[C] over不与lead搭配
[D] (lead) off（begin）开始
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：短语动词搭配 + 副词词义辨析。
事实上本题和下一个题目可以一起解答。因为第六空和第七空是所在句子整体中不可分割的两个部分。考生首先需判断选项中哪个副词可以与lead和through搭配。首先排除over，它不能与lead搭配。从结构上看，空格所在部分中的beginning with…和leading…都是现在分词状语成分，说明通信革命是怎样加速发展的：开始于运输和铁路，接着通过电报、电话、收音机和电影的发展，直到二十世纪的汽车和飞机。四个选项只有副词on可以表示“继续，向前”的含义，用在句子中强调“电报、电话、收音机和电影行业推动通信革命的继续发展”。
7.  [A] of …的，属于…的；有关…的  
[B] for 为了；代表；以…为目的地；因为
[C] beyond 超出（理解、范围、眼界）之上   
[D] into进入…之内；成为…状态
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：介词用法辨析。
根据上一题的分析，句子空格处需要一个介词和前面的begin with，lead on through一起来表达通信革命发展的全过程。选项中只有into符合，而且它和前面的leading相呼应，表达“进入20世纪的汽车和飞机时代”。
8．	[A] concept 观念，概念                    
[B] dimension 长度，宽度，高度，尺寸，大小
[C]（in）effect实际上，事实上，简直是 
[D]（in）perspective正确地、如实的（观察事物）
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：句内语义 + 介词短语搭配。
本题要求考生判断哪个名词和介词in搭配构成副词短语。空格所在句子是Not everyone sees that process in   8  （并不是每个人都…地看待这个过程）。首先排除concept和dimension，它们一般不和in搭配，即使搭配了，所表达的含义“在观念上看待这个过程”和“在尺度上看待这个过程”也不符合文意。in effect为固定搭配，如：They have no formal contract, but he is, in effect, her manager.（他们之间没有正式合同，但他实际上是她的经理），但它在文中能表达的含义“实际上看待这个过程”也不符合逻辑；只有in perspective放入句中，表示“并不是每一个人都能正确地看待这一问题”。
知识点补充：in perspective和in one’s right perspective都是固定搭配，都表示“正确、如实地（观察事物）”，如：see problems in their right perspective（如实地看待问题）。
另外，该句中，代词everyone与not搭配使用，表部分否定，意思是“不是每个人”。类似的代词或副词还有all，both，every，everyday，everybody，many，everything，entirely，absolutely，always，completely，often，wholly等，它们和not一起表达出“并非都是，不是每个都是”的含义。如：Both of them are not my brothers.（他们两个不全是我的兄弟）。I do not remember all those formulas.（这些公式我并非全都记得）。
9.  [A] indeed实际上，确实 （表强调）  [B] hence因此，所以，（表因果关系）
[C] however然而，（表转折关系）      [D] therefore因此，（表因果关系）
[答案] C
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：逻辑关系。
从结构上看，空格所在句子是一个it做形式主语的完整的主语从句It is generally recognized that the introduction of the computer radically changed the process。空格由两个逗号隔开，在主语从句中是插入语。从四个选项看，这里需填入一个逻辑连接词，表明这个句子和其前文之间的逻辑关系。
从语义上看，第一段主要论述在15、16世纪和20世纪之间发生了很多事情，如：报纸等媒介的出现和通信革命的发展。第二段一、二句综合指出正确看待这个过程很重要。从空格所在这一句开始，文章提出“计算机的出现极大地改变了这个进程”，可以判断这里的逻辑关系为转折。选项中只有however表转折。
知识点补充：像however这类逻辑连接副词在句中的位置可以是句首、句中或句尾，而当在用于句中时，与句子其他部分既可用逗号也可用分号隔开，如：①However, not everybody agreed. ②The visitor came to the door; however, it was too late for him to get in. ③The composition is all right; there is room for improvement, however.
10. [A] brought带来                     
[B] followed跟随
[C] stimulated刺激, 激励           
[D] characterized表现……的特色，刻画的……性格
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：过去分词辨析。
空格所在部分  10   by the invention of the integrated circuit during the 1960s是插入成分，插在了that引导的主语从句的主语the introduction of the computer和谓语radically changed之间，修饰从句的主语。从选项可看出空格处将填入过去分词，考生关键要判断主语“计算机在20世纪早期问世”和插入成分“集成电路在20世纪60年代发明”之间是什么联系，显然这两件事是时间先后关系。从词义上来看，只有follow表示时间先后关系，符合题意。本题最具干扰的选项是brought，但考生注意20世纪初期出现的电脑不可能由比它还晚（20世纪60年代）出现的集成电路所带来。
11. [A] unless除非，（引导条件状语从句）
    [B] since自……以来，既然，（引导时间、原因状语从句）
[C] lest惟恐，以免，（引导条件状语从句）
[D] although虽然，尽管，（引导让步状语从句）
  [答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：逻辑关系。
在做本题之前，先做第12题比较好。空格前文提到，计算机的出现大大改变了这种进程，接着空格下文又说它对媒体的影响没有立即见效。显然，这里的逻辑关系为让步。四个选项中，只有although符合要求，意为“极大地改变了这一进程。虽然对媒体的影响并没有立即见效。” 
12. [A] apparent明显的                
[B] desirable值得要的，合意的，令人想要的，悦人心意的
[C] negative否定的，消极的，负的，阴性的 
[D] plausible似是而非的
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义 + 形容词词义辨析。
空格所在句子是its impact on the media was not immediately   12  ，其中its指代的是the computer’s。首先排除plausible，因为我们不能说“影响不是立即似是而非的”。其次，根据上下文的逻辑，考生可推出虽然计算机的影响很大，但这个影响不是一蹴而就的，它刚出现时应该没有像现在这样得到这么广泛的使用，因此它对媒体的影响不是立刻就很明显的（apparent）。desirable更强调主观上的愿望，如：a home computer with many desirable features.（有许多理想性能的家庭计算机）。但计算机的影响不是我们主观上能决定的。
13. [A] institutional惯例的；公共机构的，社会事业性质的
[B] universal全体的，普通的，大众化的
[C] fundamental基础的，根本的，必要的
[D] instrumental起作用的，有助于，一般做表语
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：句内语义 + 形容词词义辨析。
从结构上来看，空格所在句子中的代词they指代前面的computers，逗号后的and连接了两个并列句子，即上句的smaller and more powerful与下文的personal as well as   13   相对应。上句的smaller和powerful在含义上有转折，意为“虽然越来越小却越来越强”，因此空格所填入的词也应与personal相对照。如果从字面上理解personal，它的含义是“私人的、个人的”，universal可以是它的反义词，但universal多做定语，强调“普遍性”，如；universal interest（普遍感兴趣），而且它在文中表达的含义“不仅被普遍使用，也被个人使用”也不符合逻辑；只有institutional与personal 相对应，指出“电脑不再仅仅是团体而且也成了个人使用的工具”，符合文意。
例句补充：Technical innovation is instrumental in improving the qualities of products.（技术革新有助于提高产品的质量）
14. [A] ability                  [B] capability
[C] capacity                [D] faculty 
[答案] C
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：名词词义辨析。
从结构上看，空格所在句子是with引导的分词独立结构：with display（逻辑主语）becoming sharper（现在分词结构） and storage  14  （逻辑主语）increasing（现在分词），来修饰前面的主句做状语。从语义上看，“计算机也成了个人工具，是随着其显示效果（display）越来越清晰（sharper）和存储…的提高”，因此空格和storage搭配后应指“（计算机的）存储能力”。考生关键要判断哪个名词能与storage搭配。四个选项都可以表示“能力”，但只有capacity可以指承受力或容纳力，和storage是固定搭配，表“存储能力”。例如：The hall has a seating capacity of 200 people（大厅可容纳200人）。
知识点补充：ability指去做某件事情的能力（精神的或生理的），如children’s ability to learn（孩子们的学习能力）；capability强调生长、发展或成功的一种潜能。如：The little girl has great capability as a singer and should be trained.（这个小女孩很有当歌手的才能，应该加以训练）；faculty指内在的、天生的力量或能力，如：the faculty to learn languages（学语言的能力）。
15. [A] by means of用…，依靠…，通过…     
[B] in terms of按照，在…方面，从…角度
[C] with regard to关于
[D] in line with符合，和…一致
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：介词短语辨析。
空格所在句子是They were thought of, like people,    15    generations，其中主语they指的仍然是computers，插入语意为“像人一样”，谓语是被动语态形式were thought of，指“被考虑，被想”，可见，空格和generations（一代人，世代，衍生代）一起做状语，修饰谓语，说明电脑是怎样被看待考虑的。因此考生重点要区分A、B选项，A 选项by means of强调“用某种方式或手段”，而B选项in terms of可以强调用某个字眼、措辞及它所传达的概念，如：Give the answer in terms of a percentage.（用百分比来回答）。根据文意，“计算机与人一样，都可以按照代（generations）来划分”，这里使用generation更多地是借用这个词和它的概念，因此正确选项为B。
例句补充：Thoughts are expressed by means of words.（思想用词汇来表达）；The work is not very profitable in terms of cash, but I am getting valuable experience from it.（这个工作从钱的角度来说不是非常有利可图，但我从中获得了宝贵经验）；He would make no concession in regard to his own rights.（他在关于自己权利的方面不会作出让步）；That isn’t in line with my ideas at all.（那和我的想法根本不一致）。
16. [A] deeper                    [B] fewer
[C] nearer                    [D] smaller 
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：习惯搭配。
本题要求考生判断哪个形容词的比较级可以修饰the distance。选项中只有smaller可以，表示“距离减小”。注意，英文中不能用near形容distance来表达“距离近”，而只用small或big这类的词来形容距离的远近。许多考生选择了A或C，是因为受到了中文思维的影响，觉得距离可以是深浅和远近。
17. [A] context （事情发生的）环境， 背景 
    [B] range山脉；（种类变化的）范围，幅度； 射程
[C] scope（处理，研究事物的）范围；（做某事物的）机会, 余地
[D] territory领土, 版图 
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：名词词义辨析。
空格所在句子是一个强调句型It was within the computer age that…，其大意是：正是在这个计算机时代，“信息社会”开始被广泛用来描述我们现在所生活的……。information society描述的当然是society，因此考生关键要判断哪个选项和society属于同一语义范畴，显然我们不能说society是“范围（range/scope）”或“领土（territory）”，而只能说是一种“环境或背景（context）”。
18. [A] regarded看待，把…作为，尊敬，涉及   [B] impressed留下印象，盖印
[C] influenced 影响                       [D] effected产生，招致，实现
[答案] C 
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：动词词义辨析。
空格所在句子是The communications revolution has    18    both work and leisure and how we think and feel both about place and time，因此考生需判断哪个动词可以描述句子主语“通信革命”对宾语“我们的工作和休闲方式以及对时间和空间的思考和感知方式”所做的动作。显然influenced是正确选项，句意为“通信革命影响了我们的众多方式”，其他三个选项和work和leisure搭配后从语义上都讲不通。
例句补充：I have always regarded him highly.（我总把他看得很高）；I wrote down whatever impressed me during the journey.（我记下旅行过程中使我感动的所有事物）；The new manager effected several changes in the company.（新来的经理在公司里促成了好几次改革）。
19. [A] competitive竞争的               [B] controversial有争议的
[C] distracting注意力不集中的        [D] irrational无理性的，不合理的
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义+ 形容词词义辨析。
本题要求考生判断哪个形容词可与view搭配，并符合文意。首先排除distracting，它不和view搭配。其次，从转折连词but可知空格所在部分there have been   19    view表示的意思和前文相反。前文指出“通信革命影响了我们工作、休闲及思考和感知的方式”，空格所在句子指出“但是关于其在经济、政治、社会和文化上的含义的看法却…”。此外，从下文中的benefits和harmful的对比以及最后一句的And generalizations have proved difficult（现在形成统一的看法还有困难）也可以知道，人们对这个通信革命影响的看法是褒贬不一的，，因此，该看法是有争议的（controversial），而不是竞争的（competitive）或不合理的（irrational）。
20. [A] above 在…上，超出                  [B] upon 在…上
[C] against 对照，对比，与…相反        [D] with 和…，同…在一起
[答案] C
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：习惯搭配。
解答本题，考生关键要知道weigh sth. against sth.或sth. is weighed against sth.是固定搭配，意为“权衡，斟酌”，如：weigh one plan against another（比较一计划与另一计划的优劣）。空格所在句子的含义是“把利益和产生的弊端进行了权衡”。

三、全文翻译
	人们曾对20世纪电视的发展以及15世纪和16世纪印刷术的传播进行了比较。然而，在这两个时段之间发生了很多事情。正如前面所讲的，直到十九世纪，报纸才继宣传册和书之后，伴随着期刊的出现，成为电子时代到来前主要的传播手段。在同一时间，通信革命也加快了步伐，先从运输和铁路开始，紧接着是电报、电话、收音机和电影，直到二十世纪的汽车和飞机。
	并不是每一个人都能正确地看待（通信革命发展）这一进程，但这一点非常重要。然而，人们普遍认识到二十世纪初期计算机的出现，及随后六十年代集成电路的发明，在极大程度上改变了这一进程，虽然它对媒体的影响并没有立即见效。随着时间的推移，计算机变得越来越小，功能却更加强。它们不仅被单位，也被个人使用。计算机的图像显示变得更加清晰，储存容量也在增加。它们被看作和人一样，可以分成几代。每一代的距离也在缩小。正是在计算机时代，“信息社会”这个词语开始被广泛地用于描述我们现实的生活环境。通信革命改变了我们的工作和休闲方式，同时也改变了我们对时间和空间的思考和感知方式。但对这一革命在经济、政治、社会和文化上的含义，人们还有争议。人们把利益和产生的弊端进行了权衡，但很难得出一个概括性的结论。

第二部分   阅读理解试题解析
Part A 

第一篇


一、文章结构总体分析
本文是关于幽默的一篇说明文，旨在教会读者如何使用幽默。文章从三个层次讲述使用幽默时应该注意的问题，并多次举例说明。
第一段：第一句话是主题句，说明为了达到幽默的效果，必须知道如何识别听话者共有的经历和问题，针对不同的听众谈不同的幽默话题。该段主要使用说理的论证手段。
第二段：举例证明上面的观点。
第三段：推理说明为什么第一段提出的方法会达到幽默的效果。
第四段：谈论幽默很重要的一个方面是注意练习，让它显得自然随意。
第五段：举例说明获得幽默的重要方法――主动寻找幽默。

二、试题具体解析
 
21. To make your humor work, you should      .
  [A] take advantage of different kinds of
audience
[B] make fun of the disorganized people
[C] address different problems to different people
[D] show sympathy for your listeners
21. 要使自己的幽默让人发笑，你应当      
_  。
[A] 利用不同类型的听众

[B] 取笑杂乱无章的人
[C] 对不同的人谈不同的问题

[D] 对你的听众表示同情
 
[答案] C
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：段落主旨题。
本题考查的是局部信息，考生关键要理解第一段。该段首句指出，如果你想在谈话中用幽默使人发笑，你就必须知道如何辨别共同的经历和共同的问题。接着作者又对此进行了解释，即：你的幽默必须与听众相关，显示你是他们中的一员，或你理解他们的处境并赞成他们的观点。作者在第三句得出结论，即“Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different（针对不同的听众，谈及不同的问题）”。由此可知，C选项恰好是对该段中心的概括，为正确答案。
A选项虽然在某种程度上谈到了“不同的听众”的重要性，但没有接着阐述听众不同应该怎样做，而且它出现了文中没有的内容：利用听众。B选项是该段最后举例说明的内容，if you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses。但这只是用来论证“听众不同问题不同”这个论点的一个具体个案，缺乏普遍性，无法由此而得出取笑他们就总会使幽默起作用的结论，因此不能选。D选项就是该段第二句谈到的in sympathy with their point of view，但是它仅仅是“对不同的人谈不同的问题”这个中心论点的部分解释，不具备完整性和概括性。
答题技巧：本题要求考生透过字里行间去把握段落主题句。注意主题句一般是观点而非描写、说明或事实。段落中除了表观点的主题句外，其他的内容一般起说明或论证作用，并且，主题句大都具有归纳性、概括性、抽象性等特点。
 
22.  The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they are     .
[A] impolite to new arrivals
[B] very conscious of their godlike role
[C] entitled to some privileges
[D] very busy even during lunch hours
22. 从那个关于医生的笑话里推出护士对医生的看法是他们____。

[A] 对新来的人没有礼貌
[B] 非常在乎自己上帝般的角色
[C] 享有某些特权
[D] 用午餐时都很忙 
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。
本题考查考生概括理解具体例子的能力，考生关键要把握作者通过举例手法所表达的观点。作者在第二段讲述了一则嘲笑医生的笑话。笑话中上帝的动作rush to grab 和stomp over都表明了上帝的傲慢和目中无人，而圣彼德的话“但是有时他认为自己是一名医生”表明医生也有同样的特点，即无礼、傲慢、自以为像上帝一样。由此可知，B选项为正确答案。
A选项不是笑话中暗示的医生的普遍特点，我们无法从笑话中得出医生对所有新来的人都不礼貌。而C选项和D选项都没有嘲笑他们的意味，因此也不对。
 
23. It can be inferred from the text that public services     .
[A] have benefited many people
[B] are the focus of public attention
[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor
[D] have often been the laughing stock
23.  从文中可以推出，公共服务____。

[A] 给许多人带来利益
[B] 是公众注意的焦点
[C] 不适合作为幽默的笑料

[D] 经常是大家的笑料 
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。
本题要求考生根据第三段的内容去推测最后一句的含义。文章第三段指出，如果谈话者是听话者中的一分子，就可以用双方共同的经历作为幽默的素材，否则，这样做就不合适。最后指出，这时如果拿公共服务行业作为替罪羊（scapegoats）去评论，你就会处于安全境地。这就说明即使对不同的听众也可以以它们为笑料，也就是说它们是大家经常谈论的笑料。因此D选项为正确答案。C 选项恰与原文意思相悖。A 选项未提到，因为当作笑料并非就是带来利益。B选项似乎也有道理，但是他的针对性不如D选项。
 
24.  To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be delivered     .
[A] in well-worded language
[B] as awkwardly as possible
[C] in exaggerated statements
[D] as casually as possible
24.为了达到预期的效果，幽默故事应该以____方式讲述。

[A] 话语措辞得当；
[B] 尽可能地不自然；
[C] 用夸张的词语；
[D] 尽可能自然。 
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：段落主旨题。
本题要求考生理解第四段的主题思想。文章第四段指出，如果在讲述幽默时感到有些不自然，就必须加以练习，使之变得更自然。你可以加入一些随便的、看上去是即兴（off-the-cuff）的话，用轻松的、自然的方式把它说出来。让听众发笑的通常是讲述幽默的过程，因此应该放慢语速，再加上一些表情，这些都在告诉人们你在讲述笑话。从该段的一些关键词natural，relaxed，unforced和light-hearted等，都可看出D选项才是讲幽默故事的正确方法。
A选项是文中未出现的内容；B选项与文章内容相悖；C选项是在第五段中谈到搜集幽默素材时应该留意的内容之一，只是列举，同样不具有概括性，因而不能入选。 
25. The best title for the text may be     .       25. 这篇文章最好的标题是      。
           
[A] Use Humor Effectively                       [A] 有效地使用幽默
[B] Various Kinds of Humor                      [B] 各种各样的幽默
[C] Add Humor to Speech                         [C] 在谈话中添加幽默
[D] Different Humor Strategies                  [D] 不同的幽默策
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：文章主旨题。
本题考的是对全文的理解，是总括题，要求考生综合各段主题找出全文的主旨。文章第一至三段谈的是选择恰当的幽默话题，以求实现幽默效果；第四段谈论的是自然随意的幽默，可以达到幽默效果；第五段建议人们留意幽默，并指出了幽默可能存在的地方，也就是实现幽默的一些策略方法。因此可知，A选项是全文都在谈论的论点，为正确的答案。
B选项不符合文章的主要内容，因为文中并未举出幽默有哪些种类。C选项也不是全文探讨的问题。D选项只是最后一段间接涉及的一些内容，如：对一句常言进行歪曲，玩弄语言文字或情景，夸大其词或是故意地轻描淡写等以求实现幽默的效果，因此无法概括全篇。

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析
长难句分析：
① Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point if view.
本句主干是Your humor must be...and should help to show...，不定式to show后是两个that 引导的宾语从句：that you are one of the them以及that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view，中间用or连接。
② Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors.
该句的主干是：Here is an example of a story，example 后是非限定性定语从句which I heard...做定语；story 后是限制性定语从句which works well做定语，其中又含有一个原因状语从句because...。work意思是“起作用，有效”。如：How long does a sleeping pill take to work? 安眠药要多长时间才起作用？
③ If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties.
该句子有多重结构。第一重是，句首if引导的条件从句和主句构成主从复合句。if从句充当主句的条件状语，主句由两个并列的分句构成：you will be...and it’ll be appropriate....。第二重是，if从句中的group后接有一个限定性定语从句which you are addressing做定语，主句中前一个分句中不定式的宾语the experiences and problems 后接which 引导的定语从句做定语，后一分句的结构是it’ll be appropriate for sb. to do sth....。
be in a position to do sth.意思是“由于客观或主观条件”可能做某事。如：He is in a position to marry.他有条件结婚。passing 意思是：粗略的，随便的，仓促的。如：a passing mention 顺便提及。
④ With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman.
句中as 引导的是原因状语从句，will在这里是情态动词，表示某种推测。cut in with sth.意思是“以……插入”。
佳句赏析：
① Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different.
这就是我们常说的“因人而异”的英文版说法。
② If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.
两个if条件从句的并列、talking to和addressing、refer to和comment on的替换以及disorganized的重复，使该句子变化中有重复，动中有静。


四、核心词汇与超纲词汇
(1) identify（v.）认出，识别；鉴定；identification（n.）识别，身份证明，简写成ID。
(2) sympathy（n.）同情，同感；be in～with sb./sth. 同意，赞同。如：We are all in～with your proposals. sym-前缀表示“相同的”；anti-表示“相反的”，如：antipathy反感。
(3) address（v.）与…说话，向…致辞，演说；从事，忙于
(4) alternatively（ad.）作为选择，或者；这个词在写作中常用来引导另外一个平行的观点或意见；alternative（a./n.）二者择一（的），选择性（的）

(6) accommodations（n.）住处，住所；座位，车厢；适应；便利的设备，有帮助的事物
(7) St. Peter 圣彼德，St.是Saint的缩写，是人们对耶稣基督的尊称。
(8) stomp（n./v.）跺脚，践踏，重踏
(9) passing（a.）经过的，短暂的，匆匆的，随便的，偶然的，及格的
(10) notorious（a.）声名狼藉的，臭名昭著的；notorious是一个贬义词。表示“名气很大”的贬义词还有infamous。褒义词很多，如：famous，well-known，renowned等。
（11）resent（v.）愤恨，怨恨，对…感觉不愉快；resentment（n.）
（12）disparaging（a.）蔑视的，轻视的，毁谤的
（13）scapegoat（n.）替罪羊。记住goat，与“羊”有关的词语还有black sheep害群之马。
（14）understatement（n.）一种修辞手法，故意的轻描淡写；under-前缀表示“未达，未满，不足”，如：undertreatment处理不足或不力，underestimate，underripe不成熟的。
（15）turn about转变，改变意见，转身，反复思考


 
五、全文翻译
如果你想在谈话中用幽默来使人发笑，你就必须知道如何识别共同的经历和共同的问题。你的幽默必须与听众有关，向他们表明你是他们中的一员，或者你了解他们的处境并同情他们的观点。（长难句①）根据谈话对象的不同，问题也有所不同。（佳句①）如果你在和一群经理谈话，你就可以评论他们秘书紊乱的工作方法；相反，如果你在和一群秘书谈话，你就可以评论他们毫无章法的老板。（佳句②）
下面举一个例子，它是我在一个护士大会上听到的。这个故事效果很好，因为听众对医生都有同样的看法。（长难句②）一个人到了天堂，由圣彼得带着他参观。他看到了豪华的住宅、美丽的花园、晴朗的天气等等。所有人都很安静、礼貌和友善，然而当这位新来的人在排队等候午餐时，突然被一位穿白大褂的人推到一旁。只见这人挤到了队伍的前头，抓起他的食物，噔噔地旁若无人地走到一张餐桌旁。“这是谁啊?”新来的人问圣彼得,“哦，那是上帝，”他回答说，“但有时也认为自己是一名医生。”
如果你是你谈话对象集体中的一员，你就有条件去了解你们所共有的经历和问题，你就可对餐厅极难吃的食物或者总裁在选择领带方面差劲的品味进行评头论足。（长难句③）而对于其他听众，你就不能试图贸然地讲这种幽默，因为他们也许不喜欢外人对他们的餐厅或总裁有如此微词。（长难句④）但如果你选择去评论邮局或电话局这样的替罪羊，那你就会很安全。
如果你在幽默时感到很别扭，你应该进行练习使它变得更自然。包括一些很随便的、看上去是即兴的话，你可以用轻松的、不做作的方式把它们说出来。常常是你说话的方式使听众发笑，因此说慢一些，并且记住扬扬眉毛或者做出一种不相信的表情都会向人们显示你正在说笑话。
留意幽默，它常常是在出其不意的时候出现。它可以是一句常言的歪曲如“你要是一开始不成功，就放弃”，或者是调侃词藻和场景；寻求夸大其词和轻描淡写；考虑一下你的谈话，选出一些词汇和句子，对它们反复琢磨，并注入一些幽默。

第二篇


一、文章结构总体分析
本文是一篇关于机器人科技发展的文章。文章首先介绍机器人科技发展取得的成果，接着谈到它的局限性，即机器人和人类在智能上的差距。
第一、二段：指出自从人类开始有了创造力，就一直在设计日益巧妙的工具去处理那些危险的、困难的工作，其结果是机器充斥了人类的生活并节省了许多劳动力。
第三至五段：指出机器人如果要进入节省劳力的下一个阶段，它必须能够独立地解决问题，但是这是一个艰巨的任务。目前研究人员已经将机器人模仿人脑活动的预想向后推迟了数十年，甚至数百年，因为人脑在迅速变化的环境中的高聚焦能力是机器人无法做到的。

 in      .                    
［A］the use of machines to produce science    ［A］使用机器去创作科幻小说
fiction
［B］the wide use of machines in manufacturing ［B］制造业中机器的广泛使用
  industry
［C］the invention of tools for difficult and  ［C］发明工具去处理困难和危险
dangerous work                                的工作
［D］the elite’s cunning tackling of          ［D］精英们对危险、乏味的工作
dangerous and boring work                     的灵巧处理
  ［答案］C
［解析］本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
本题是个局部题，考查考生是否看懂了第一段。题干中的initially与原文的the dawn对应。该段第一句指出“自从人类开始有了创造力，就一直在设计日益巧妙的工具来处理一些危险、乏味、繁重或者是讨厌的工作”。C选项是对此句的恰当改写：the invention of tools与devised ever more cunning tools对应，for difficult and dangerous work与to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty对应，因此它是正确答案。A选项是文章中没有的内容，其中的干扰词science fiction 只在第一段末尾提到，“如果说科学家还没有创造出机械版的科幻小说，他们也已经接近这个目标了”，这里只是通过打比方来形容科学家创造的机器工具越来越灵巧，和科幻小说一样神奇。B选项是智慧的表现，但却不是人类智慧的最初表现。D选项谈的是文中没有的“精英人物”。
27．The word “gizmos”  (line 1,            27．第二段第一行中的“gizmo”在句中
paragraph 2) most probably means.            可能的意思是____。
[A] programs                                 [A] 程序
[B］experts                                  [B] 专家
[C］devices	[C] 设备
[D］creatures	[D] 生物
［答案］C
［解析］本题考核的知识点是：词义题。
本题考查学生从上下文猜测词义的能力。文章第二段第一句指出“现代世界充斥着越来越多聪明的gizmos，虽然我们几乎都注意不到他们，但他们的普遍存在却节省了许多人类劳力”，由此可知gizmos的特点是：普遍存在和节省劳力。下文提到的“工厂的机器人”、“银行的自动柜员机”、“地铁的机器人司机”、“医院做手术的机器人系统”对“gizmos”进一步举例说明，由此可猜出gizmos指的是“机器、设备或装置”，C选项正确。其他三个选项都不在本文讨论的对象范围之内。
28．According to the text, what is       28． 根据文章，现在超出人类能力范围的是
beyond man’s ability now is to design a      制造能_____的机器人。
robot that can___.
［A］fulfill delicate tasks like performing    [A] 完成类似于做大脑手术这样需
brain surgery                               要高技术的任务
［B］interact with human beings verbally       [B]与人进行口头交流
［C］have a little common sense                [C]有一点点常识
［D］respond independently to a changing world [D]独立地对变化的世界做出反应
［答案］D
［解析］本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
文章第三段首句指出“机器人若要进入节省劳力的下一个阶段，它们必须能够在更少的人工监控下运行，并且至少能够自己做些决定，这样的目标为我们提出了一个真正的挑战”；接着在第二句里作者谈到此项挑战之所以艰巨的原因是：“尽管我们知道如何让机器人处理一个具体的错误，但是我们不能给它们足够的‘常识’使其与不断变化的世界进行可靠的交流”。由此可知，机器人目前还必须在人的操控下工作，它还不能独立适应不断变化的外部环境。D选项是对原句‘common sense’to reliably interact with a dynamic world的改写，为正确答案。
A和B选项均在第二段提及（医院做手术的机器人和自动取款机），可见这样的机器人是人能够造出来的。C选项不正确，因为第三段指出的“但是我们不能给他们足够的‘常识’去与动态世界进行可靠的交流”说明目前的机器人还是有一点点常识的。
29．Besides reducing human labor, robots can     29．除了能够节省劳力外，机器人
also       .                                     还能_____。
［A］make a few decisions for themselves           [A] 自己做些决定
［B］deal with some errors with human intervention  [B] 在人的干预下处理一些错误
［C］improve factory environments                  [C] 改善工厂的环境
［D］cultivate human creativity                    [D] 开发人类创造性
［答案］B
［解析］本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
文章第三段（翻译见上一题）说明当前阶段机器人只能在较多的人工监控下运行，可以处理具体的错误但不能独立地做决定，因此只有B选项的内容是机器人可以做的，排除A选项。文章提到工厂的机器人是用于节省人类劳动力，而不是改善环境的，排除C选项；D选项本末倒置，应该是人类创造力推动了机器人的发明。
30．The author uses the example of a monkey to  30．作者以猴子为例想要说明机
 argue that robots are       .                 器人_____。
［A］expected to copy human brain in internal   [A] 有望被用来复制人脑的内部结构
structure
［B］able to perceive abnormalities immediately[B] 能够立即感知不正常的现象
［C］far less able than human brain in focusing [C] 在聚焦相关信息方面远不如人脑
 on relevant information
［D］best used in a controlled environment     [D] 最好在一个被控制的环境下使用
［答案］C
［解析］本题考核的知识点是：作者意图题。
本题表面上是考查例证写作的意图，实际上却考查了对文章最后一段的理解。该段的主题句是首句：研究人员发现，人类大脑中的近一千亿个神经细胞要比以前想象的更聪明，人类的感觉器官也更复杂。接下来作者通过对机器人和人脑的比较来说明段落主题，“机器人能够在人工控制的工厂环境下识别机器控制面板上不到一毫米的误差；但是人脑扫一眼一个快速变化的场景，就能迅速排除98%的不相干信息，立即把注意力集中到婉蜒的森林小路边的一只猴子，或者一大群人中的一张可疑的面孔上”。该段末句既对前面比较论证部分的目的进行说明，又重申了主题：世界上最先进的机器人也无法和人脑相比。可见文中举猴子的例子只是为了说明人脑的复杂性。四个选项中只有C选项说明机器人不如人脑，符合题意。

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析
长难句分析：
① And if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.
该句子是含if条件从句的主从复合句。注意其中词汇的用法。从句中have yet to表否定，意为“尚未，还不得不”；the mechanical version of science fiction是“机械版的科幻小说”，也就是指科幻小说中的梦想在机器人上的实现；主句中的come close是“走近”，而不是come to a close（结束，完成）。
② As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor.
该句子的主干是the modern world is populated by intelligent gizmos，宾语gizmos后是两个whose引导的定语从句做定语：whose presence…but whose universal existence…。
③ And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy―far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.
该句的主干是there are robot systems，systems后是that引导的定语从句，破折号后面的部分用来补充说明submillimeter accuracy。句首介词短语thanks to（由于，多亏…）引导原因状语。 
④ But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves―goals that pose a real challenge.
该句子是含if条件从句的主从复合句，句首but表示对上一段内容的转折。主句的主干是they will have to operate...and be able to make decisions...。破折号后是一个补充说明成分，修饰整个主句，其中goals指的是前面主句的两个并列谓语动作，后面还有that引导的定语从句。If从句中be to do结构表示一种愿望，可译为“要想…”，又如：If you are to succeed you must be patient and persistent.（要想成功，就必须有耐心，有毅力），这种结构还可以表示安排（They are to marry next week.）、命令（You are to be back by 10 o’clock.）、禁止（Children are not to smoke.）等。
⑤ Despite a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.
该句子的特点是状语修饰成分较长。从despite开始一直到2010都是句子的让步状语，意为“尽管…”，其中含有关系副词when引导的定语从句限定时间名词the 1960s and 1970s。句子的主干是researchers have begun to extend that forecast。a spell of意思是“一段时间”，It appeared that意思是“似乎，好像”，如:It appears that you have known the news.（你好像已经知道这个消息了）。
⑥ What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented―and human perception far more complicated―than previously imagined.
该句中的特点是插入语的使用。句子主干是What they found is that...，主语和be动词间的插入成分是介词in+现在分词结构做状语。be动词后是that引导的表语从句，该从句其实是两个句子的糅合，即nerve cells are much more talented than previously imagined和human perception is far more complicated than previously imagined，句子通过破折号的方式把两个句子共同的部分省略掉了。
⑦ But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd.
该句子关键要把握其结构上对几个动词的处理：the human mind can glimpse...and disregard..., focusing on…or…”，前两个动词由and连接，做主句的谓语，第三个动词focus on变为分词结构做结果状语。glimpse接的宾语是由定语从句修饰的中心名词98 percent，focus on接的宾语是由连词or连接的两个并列成分：the monkey or the single suspicious face。 
佳句赏析：
Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robo-drivers.
排比句的运用通过罗列反映出我们现在的生活里到处都有机器人的影子。拟人手法的使用赋予了机器人很多人的特质，生动地表现出他们和人的相似性，如：robot arms，automated teller terminals thank us with politeness，tireless robo-drivers。

五 全文翻译
自从人类开始有了创造力，就一直在设计日益巧妙的工具来处理那些危险、枯燥、繁重或者是讨厌的工作。这样一种驱动力导致了机器人学的诞生，即赋予机器以人的各种技能的科学。如果说科学家还没有实现科幻小说中对机器的幻想，他们也已经很接近这个目标了（长难句①）。
由此引起的结果是，现代世界充斥着越来越多的智能仪器，虽然我们几乎都注意不到他们，但他们的普遍存在却节省了许多人类劳力（长难句②）。我们的工厂里轰鸣着机器人组装臂的节奏声；我们的银行业务完成于自动柜员机旁，完成业务后，它们还会用机器语言礼貌地感谢我们；我们的地铁车由不知疲倦的机器人司机驾驶。（佳句①）由于电子器件和微型机械仪器的不断缩小，现在已出现了机器人系统能够进行精确到毫米的脑部和骨髓手术，其精确性远远超过熟练的医生仅用他们的双手所达到的水平（长难句③）。
但是要想让机器人进入节省劳力的下一个阶段，它们必须能够在更少的人工监控下运行，并且至少能够独立地作一些决定。这些是真正具有挑战性的目标。（长难句④）“虽然我们知道如何让机器人去处理一个特定的错误，”NASA的一个机器人项目经理戴维?拉维里说，“但是我们不能给它们足够的‘常识’使其与不断变化的世界进行可靠的交流”。
实际上对真正的人工智能的探索己经取得了各种不同的成果。虽然在20世纪60年代和70年代有过一段乐观的时期――那时侯仿佛晶体管电路和微处理器的发展使人们相信它们在2010年能够复制人类大脑的活动――但是最近研究人员己经开始将这个预测延后数十年，甚至数百年（长难句⑤）。
在试图建造思维模型的过程中，研究人员发现，人类大脑中的近一千亿个神经细胞要比以前想象的更聪明，人类的感觉器官也更复杂（长难句⑥）。他们建造的机器人在严格控制的工厂环境里，能够在机器控制面板上识别毫米以下的误差。但是人脑扫一眼一个快速变化的场景，就能迅速排除98%的不相干信息，立即聚焦于婉蜒的森林小路边的一只猴子，或者一大群人中的一张可疑的面孔上（长难句⑦）。世界上最先进的计算机系统也不达不到这种能力。神经学科学家至今仍然不知道我们人类是怎样做到这一点的。

第三篇


一、文章结构总体分析
这是一篇关于油价上涨对全球经济影响的文章。文章主要分析了油价上涨不会造成全球经济衰退的原因。文章前两段为引子（引起读者的兴趣并交待背景），第三段给出作者观点，紧接着用三个理由对其观点加以支持。
第一段：以提问和数据两种方式提出作者关注的问题：这次石油价格上涨会不会像前两次一样造成经济衰退？以便引起读者的兴趣。
第二段：补充说明油价上涨的另外两个因素，交代所讨论问题的背景。
第三段：第一句话为全文的中心思想，也是对第一段提出问题的回答，即：不会导致经济滑坡，接着给出一个理由――原油仅占汽油价格的一小部分。
第四段：给出支持作者论点的第二个理由：大国经济对石油的依赖性不大。本段主要使用数据进行论证。
第五段：不会导致经济滑坡的第三个理由：没有整体的物价上涨为大背景。论证中使用70年代的情况作为参照与现在的情况进行比较。

二、试题具体解析 
31. The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is     
[A] global inflation
[B] reduction in supply
[C] fast growth in economy
[D] Iraq’s suspension of exports
31．最近石油价格上涨的主要原因是     

[A] 全球性通货膨胀
[B] 石油供应量下降
[C] 经济快速增长；
[D] 伊拉克暂停石油出口。
 
[答案] B
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
第一段明确指出“自从石油输出国组织在3月决定减少原油供应以来，原油的价格便从去年12月的不到10美元一桶上升至约26美元一桶”，因此B选项为正确答案。
A选项是第一段提到的前两次油价暴涨造成的后果，而非原因。 C选项和D选项是第二段提到的进一步推动油价上涨的原因，而非主要原因。
答题技巧：题干中如果有找出主要原因之类的提法，说明原文中肯定有不止一个原因，命题意图是检查考生能否从众多信息中抓住主要信息。
 
32． It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up dramatically if     
[A] price of crude rises
[B] commodity prices rise
[C] consumption rises
[D] oil taxes rise
32．从文中可以推出，在什么情况下，石油零售价格会大幅上涨？

[A] 原油价格上涨
[B] 商品价格上涨
[C] 消费上涨
[D] 石油税上涨
 
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。
文章第三段指出，原油价格只占汽油零售价格的一小部分，其大部分(在欧洲高达五分之四)是税收，因此原油价格的变动对汽油价格影响不大。由此可知，影响汽油价格的主要因素是税收。D选项为正确答案，而不是A选项。B选项是前两次石油涨价产生的结果（第1段第4句）；而C选项文中未提及。
答题技巧：命题目的是检查考生能否通过文章所给事实推出二者的潜在关系。对于此题，需要考生准确把握price的具体所指，方能正确解题。
 
33． The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries      .
[A] heavy industry becomes more energy intensive
[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices
[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed
[D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP
33． 在《经济展望》中的文章估计在发达国家      。
[A] 重工业消耗更多能源

[B] 收入的损失来自原油价格的波动

[C] 制造业受到严重冲击

[D] 油价变化队GDP没有很大影响
 
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。
根据“rich countries”可断定答案大抵在第四段，原文为“Rich economies”。文中提到，“国际经合组织在最近一期的《经济展望》中估计，如果油价持续一年维持在每桶22美元左右，与1998年的13美元一桶相比，也只会使发达国家的石油进口在支出增加GDP的0.25%～0.5%”。这个数据表明影响不是很大，因此D选项为正确答案。
B选项和C选项文中没有提及，A选项和题干不能构成因果关系。
 
34.  We can draw a conclusion from the text that    
            .
[A] oil price shocks are less shocking now
[B] inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks
[C] energy conservation can keep down the oil prices
[D] the price rise of crude leads to the 
shrinking of heavy industry         


34. 从课文中，可以得出的结论是     
          。
[A] 现在的油价暴涨并不可怕
[B] 通货膨胀与油价暴涨无关
 
[C] 能源储备可以抑制油价

[D] 原油价格上涨导致重工业的
    萎缩    
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。
文章一开始提出最近石油价格大幅上涨，接下来阐述这次油价上涨不会造成经济衰退的原因：（1）原油价格只占汽油价格的一小部分；（2）发达国家对石油的依赖性不如从前；（3）此次油价上涨并不在商品总价格上涨和全球需求旺盛这种大环境中发生。因此，综合全文得出的结论是A选项。
B选项与文中通货膨胀是石油危机的结果相悖（第1段第4句）。C选项（第4段第2句）和D选项（第4段最后一句）都是文中的事实细节，并非综合全文而得到的结论。 
35. From the text we can see that the writer  35．作者对“油价上涨”所持的态度为      
 seems     .
[A] optimistic                               [A] 乐观
[B] sensitive                                [B] 敏感
[C] gloomy	                  [C] 悲伤
[D] scared	                  [D] 害怕
[答案] A
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：作者态度题。
作者大篇幅地给出理由说明这次油价上涨的后果不会很严重。第三段谈到，“我们有充分的理由预期这次油价暴涨给经济带来的影响不会像20世纪70年代那么严重”，最后一段第一句话又谈到“另一个不应该因为油价上升而失眠的原因是，与20世纪70年代不同，这次油价上升不是发生在普遍的物价暴涨及全球需求过旺背景之下”。可见A选项表达了作者的真正态度。

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析
长难句分析：
① This near tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979～1980, when they also almost tripled.
句子主干是This near tripling of oil prices ...calls up... memories of the 1973 ... and 1979～1980 ...其中of oil prices 修饰前面的tripling ，of the 1973和1979～1980修饰memories。1973以及1979～1980后面又分别跟了两个when引导的定语从句对时间进行修饰。
② Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term. 
该句主语Strengthening economic growth和谓语could push之间放入一个时间状语作插入成分，用逗号与主句隔开。
③ The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25%～0.5% of GDP.
句子主干是The OECD estimates ...that ...，that后是宾语从句，在这个从句中又含有一个if引导的条件状语，主语是this，指的就是这个条件句，谓语是would increase…，compared with $13 in 1998是一个状语。
④On the other hand, oil importing emerging economies―to which heavy industry has shifted―have become more energy intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.
句子主干是oil importing emerging economies ...have become ...and so could be ...；其中在主语和第一个谓语后放入一个which引导的定语从句修饰主语作插入成分。
⑤One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity price inflation and global excess demand.
句子主干是... reason ... is that ...。not to lose sleep over …是reason的后置定语。that 引导的表语从句比较复杂，其中包括一个形容词短语unlike…做状语，主语it指的是前文提到的the rise in oil prices。
知识点补充：lose sleep over意思是“因…而失眠”；occurred against the background of ... 意思是“发生在…的背景下”。
佳句赏析：
So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?
句中的gloom and doom用了尾韵的修辞方法，很有节奏感。

四、核心词汇与佳句赏析
（1）conservation（n.）保护；保存；保护区
（2）conserve（v.）保存
（3）crude（a.）天然的；未加工的；粗制的；粗鲁的
（4）doom（n.）毁灭，灭亡
（5）energy intensive（a.）能源密集型的
（6）gloom（n.）黑暗，阴暗
（7）hemisphere（n.）半球，半球体
（8）quadruple（a.）四倍的；quadri= quadru前缀，表示“四”，如：quadruple 四倍的；quadrilingual 能用四种语言的
（9）squeeze（v.）压榨，挤，挤榨
（10）swing（v.）摇摆，摆动，回转，回旋；（n.）秋千，摇摆，摆动

五、全文翻译
过去经济衰落的坏日子是否会重来？自从石油输出国组织在3月决定减少原油供应以来，原油的价格便从去年12月的不到10美元一桶上升到到约26美元一桶。这次近三倍的涨价令人想起了1973年和1979-1980年两次可怕的石油恐慌，当时的油价分别是涨了四倍和近三倍。（长难句①）前两次的油价暴涨都导致了两位数的通货膨胀率以及全球性的经济衰退。那么这次警告人们厄运来临的头版新闻都到哪里去了呢？（佳句①）
本周伊拉克暂停石油出口，这使油价又一次上扬。强劲的经济增长势头，随着北半球冬季的到来，有可能在短期内使石油价格涨得更高。（长难句②）
然而，我们有充分的理由预期这次油价暴涨给经济带来的影响不会象20世纪70年代那么严重。与70年代相比，现在多数国家的原油价格占汽油价格的分额要小。在欧洲，税金在汽油零售价的比例高达五分之四，因此，即使原油价格发生很大的波动，汽油价格所受的影响也不会象过去那么显著。 
发达国家对石油的依赖性也不如从前，因此对油价的波动也就不会那么敏感。能源储备、燃料替代以及能源密集型重工业的重要性降低，这些都减少了石油消耗量。软件、咨询及移动通讯消耗的石油，比钢铁、汽车行业少得多。发达国家国内生产总值（以目前价格计算）中，每一个美元所消耗的石油量比1973年少了近一半。国际经合组织在最近一期的《经济展望》中估计，如果油价持续一年维持在22美元左右，与1998年的13美元一桶相比，这也只会使发达国家的石油进口支出上增加GDP的0.25―0.5个百分点。（长难句③）这还不到1974年或1980年收入减少部分的四分之一。另一方面，进口石油的新兴国家由于转向了重工业，消耗能量更大，因此可能会受到石油危机的强烈影响。（长难句④）
另外一个不应因油价上升而失眠的原因是，与20世纪70年代不同，这次油价上升不是发生在普遍的物价暴涨及全球需求过旺背景之下。（长难句⑤）世界上很多地区才刚刚走出经济衰落。《经济学家》的商品价格指数与一年前相比，总体上没有什么变化。1973年的商品价格跃升了70%，而1979年也上升了近30%。

第四篇

一、文章结构总体分析
本文讲述的是美国法律和医学界对于医生协助病人结束生命这一医疗措施的支持态度。这篇文章理解起来的困难在于段落数量较多以及意群分散，有时同一意群的内容分为两段论述。
第一、二段：从语意上讲实际是一个段落，第一段只有一句话，指出最高法院的裁决对医生协助病人结束生命这一现象的重要性，第二段推理证明为什么重要。
第三段：首先指出医生协助病人结束生命这一现象并不是新鲜事物，进而引用南希?杜勒尔的话说明最高法院的裁决产生的影响在于保护医生。
第四段：依然使用引证的方法说明第三段“保护医生”的论点。
第五、六段：从语意上讲又是一个段落，第五段是主题句，说明该裁决的另一个推动因素，即，病人不愿忍受死亡的折磨。第六段使用典型事例对此进行论证。
第七段：第一句为主题句，说明对此医学界采取的行动。
第八段：采用引证法说明律师可以起关键作用。

[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
这是一道总括性的题，需要以文章中的多处信息为线索。选项B是文章第二段首句的改写。该句提到，法院在判决中承认医生协助病人结束生命不是宪法赋予的权利。选项中的“illegal”对应文中“no constitutional right”，“doctors to help the dying end their lives”对应“physician-assisted suicide”。
选项A的时间与原文不符。“used to do”意为“过去常常做……事情（但是现在不做了）”，而文章第三段提到，近年来医生一直使用这个原则为他们使用大剂量的吗啡去控制临死病人（terminally ill patients）的痛苦进行辩护。选项C与原文意思相反。第二段首句明确提出，法院实际上对这种“双重效果”的医疗原则表示了支持（in effect supported the medical principle）。选项D在文中未提及，原文只提到医生没有宪法赋予的权利去协助病人结束生命。
答题技巧：这种跨段落的细节题，正确选项一般是对原文中某语句的改写或替换，错误选项则与原文意义相悖或无关。
 
37. Which of the following statements its true according to the text?
[A] Doctors will be held guilty if they 
37. 按照课文，下列哪个观点是正确的?

[A] 如果医生冒病人死亡的风险，他将被认
risk their patients’death.
[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.
[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.
[D] A doctor’s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.

为有罪。
[B] 现代医学一直在帮助那些临死病人进行无痛康复。
 
[C] 法院判决，医生可以开大剂量镇痛药。


[D] 医生开出的药是否合法不再取决于他们的意图。

 
[答案] C     
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
本题也是总括性的题目，信息比较分散。文章第二段和第三段分别提到：法院对“双重效果”的医疗原则表示支持，而近年来医生一直使用这个原则为他们使用大剂量吗啡进行辩护。按照逻辑推理，法院支持原则，医生利用原则做某事，那么法院应该支持这件事。因此，选项C为正确答案。
选项A与原文意思相反。“hold sb.(to be) a/n.”意为“认为、相信某人怎样”，如：I hold the parents responsible for their children’s behavior. 第五段谈到，外科手术中，医生虽然冒了病人死亡的风险，但是我们不把这种情况下的死亡称作他杀，因为医生并非有意要杀死病人，即医生没有责任。选项B与原文不符。第六段提到，引起病人绝望的原因恰恰是现代医学一直只能延长他们死亡前的肉体痛苦。选项D与原文意思相反。第五段中健康法律系主任通过外科手术的例子说明，意图是决定医生所开的药物合不合法的关键，其含义是只要意图是好的，即使出现坏的结果也是可以接受的。
 
38. According to the NAS’s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is     .
[A]prolonged medical procedures
[B]inadequate treatment of pain
[C]systematic drug abuse
[D]insufficient hospital care
38. 根据NAS的报告，临终关怀的问题之一是     。

[A] 延长的医疗程序
[B] 对病痛处理不力
[C] 蓄意的药物滥用
[D] 医院护理不足 
[答案] B 
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
根据关键字“NAS报告”和“临终关怀”定位第七段。全国科学院发布的报告中明确提到了临终关怀的两个问题：（1）undertreatment of pain（对病痛不进行足够的处理）；(2) the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures”（大胆使用“无效和强制的医疗程序去延长死亡期甚至让病人死得很没有尊严）”。因此选项B是提到的问题之一。A和D选项是干扰项，A选项中的prolonged、medical procedures是原文中出现的词汇，D选项中的insufficient和undertreatment近义，但它们都只是词语的重新组合，含义上和原文有出入。Ｃ项中的“systematic”意为“planned in advance and done with malicious thoroughness and exactness”(有预谋的、蓄意的)。如：a systematic attempt to ruin one’s reputation (蓄意破坏某人的名誉)。
 
39. Which of the following best defines the word “aggressive” (line 2, paragraph 7)?
39. 第七段第二行出现的aggressive的含义是什么？

[A] Bold.
[B] Harmful.
[C] Careless.
[D] Desperate.
[A] 大胆的。
[B] 有害的。
[C] 粗心的。
[D] 不顾一切的。 
[答案] B
[解析]本题考核的知识点是：词义题。
原文谈到的是一种使用“无效和强制的医疗程序去延长死亡期甚至让病人死得很没有尊严”的做法，考生需判断哪个形容词可以替代aggressive来描述这种行为。“aggressive”这个词用于褒义时，意为“强有力的、坚持己见的”，用于贬义时，意为“攻击性的、不顾后果的”。选项A“Bold”用于贬义时意为“大胆的、冒失的、失慎的”，意义最接近。
知识点补充：介词of可用于两个名词（短语）之间，前者形容后者，如：He’s got the devil of temper(devil形容temper)；Where’s that fool of a receptionist？（fool 形容receptionist）。同样，这里的aggressive use 用来形容ineffectual and forced medical procedures。
40.  George Annas would probably agree that   40. 乔治?安纳斯认为在以下哪一种情    
doctors should be punished if they             况下，医生应该受到制裁?
[A] manage their patients incompetently.       [A] 不能胜任管理病人的工作。
[C] reduce drug dosages for their patients.    [B] 给病人的药物超量。
[B] give patients more medicine than needed.   [C] 减少病人的药物剂量。
[D] prolong the needless suffering of the      [D] 延长病人不必要的痛苦
patients.
[答案] D
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。
在最后一段中安纳斯明确指出，painful deaths(病人痛苦的死亡)should result in license suspension(应该使那些对此漠不关心的医生受到惩罚，吊销执照)，因此选项D“延长病人不必要的痛苦”是医生受制裁的原因。
选项A太泛，不一定是指的是无视病人痛苦这一方面。文章第五段提到，安纳斯认为只要医生开的药物是用于合法的医疗目的，就没有违法，而不存在药量多少的问题。因此，可以排除选项B和C。


 
三、文章长难句分析和佳句赏析
长难句分析：
①Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect,” a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects―a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen―is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.
这是个一句话的段落，其中心结构是the Court supported the medical principle，Although引导的分句与后面构成转折关系。a centuries-old moral principle...good effect是对the medical principle of “double effect”进行解释说明的同位语，其主干是principle holding that an action... is permissible。
②Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death.” 
该句的基本结构是Nancy Dubler contends that the principle will shield doctors，who引导的定语从句修饰doctors。注意insist后面有接虚拟语气和非虚拟语气两种用法。前者意为“坚持要求、坚持认为”，如：I insisted that you (should) take immediate action to put this right，后者意为“坚持说、固执声称”，如：She insisted that she was innocent.这里应该取第二种意思。
另外在新闻报道体裁的文章中引用某专家的言论，多采用这种句式结构，即人名+职位+动词（contend, maintain，hold，believe等）+that引导的宾语从句。本文在第四段和第五段就两次出现。
③It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying” as the twin problems of end-of-life care.
该句子的主干是It identifies... as ...，identify接的宾语是由and连接的两个of短语：undertreatment of pain和aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures，其中第二个of的宾语后紧跟着一个定语从句做定语。
④“Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering,” to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse”.
该句的主干是physicians seem unconcerned with the pain... to the extent that...，pain后面由一个省略了关系代词的定语从句修饰，needlessly and predictably意为“既没有必要又不可避免”。extend后也接了一个that引导的定语从句。
佳句赏析：
①On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.
On another level是全文的分界点，起着切换话题的作用。fueled in part by运用暗喻的修辞手法，形象地描述了后面的现象对这场争论起到推波助澜的作用。
②The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.
该句将四个to引导的不定式结构并列，使句式显得整齐而具有气势。

四、核心词汇与超纲词汇
(1) physician-assisted这个词语的构词法是名词+|过去分词=复合形容词，它相当于assisted by physician（由医生协助的），类似的词有：weather-beaten饱经风霜的 state-owned国有的
(2) implications（n.）暗示，隐含义，牵连，推论；imply（v.）暗示，暗指；意味，包含；implicative（a.）含蓄的, 连带的
(3)  shield（n.）盾，防护物；（v.）保护，遮蔽。Shield...from...: 保护…免受…(的侵害)，如：shield his eyes from the sun
(4) homicide（n.）杀人（者），词根cide意为“杀”，如：suicide自杀，patricide弑父，matricide弑父
(5) undertreatment（a.）处理不足或不力。Under-前缀意为“未达，未满，不足”，如：underripe不够成熟的
(6) ineffectual（a.）无效的，不起作用的。与ineffective意思相近但是有所区别，ineffectual强调“不起作用”，而ineffective强调“工作效率低”。
(7) hospice（n.）收容所, 济贫院
(8) initiatives（n.）首创精神，主动（权），动机；（a.）起始的，初步的，自发的
(9) presumptively（ad.）据推测，可据以推定，可认为是
（10）suspension（n.）悬，吊，悬挂物；悬而未决；保留，中止，暂停，吊销，停职，停学 suspend（v.）suspensive（a.）

五、全文翻译
最高法庭关于医生协助病人自杀问题的裁决，对于医学界寻求减轻病危者的痛苦，具有重要的意义。
尽管裁决认为，宪法没有赋予医生帮助病人自杀的权利，然而最高法庭实际上却认可了 “双效”的医疗原则，这个存在了好几个世纪的道德原则认为，如果某种行为具有双重效果（希望达到的好效果和可以预见得到的坏效果），那么，只要行为实施的目的是想达到好效果，这个行为就是可以被允许的。（长难句①）
近年来，医生们一直在借用这项原则，为自己替病危患者注射大剂量的吗啡镇痛的做法提供正当的理由，尽管他们知道，不断增加的剂量最终会杀死病人。
蒙特非奥里医疗中心主任南希?道布勒认为，这项原则将保护一些医生，他们直到现在还坚持说，在大量药物可能加速病人死亡的情况下，他们总不能给病人开足够的药来帮助他们止痛。（长难句②）
波士顿大学健康法律系主任乔治?安纳斯坚持认为，只要医生是出于合理的医疗目的开药，那么即使此药会加速病人的死亡，医生的行为也没有违法。“这就像做手术，”他说，“尽管医生冒着病人死亡的危险，我们也不能称那些死亡为谋杀，因为医生并没有想杀死病人。假定你是一名医生，只要你的目的不是让病人自杀，你就可以去冒你病人自杀的风险。”
另一方面，许多医疗界人士承认，致使医助自杀这场争论升温的部分原因是由于病人们的绝望情绪，对这些病人来说，现代医学延长了临终前肉体的痛苦。(佳句①)
就在最高法庭对医助自杀进行裁决的前三周，全国科学学会公布了一份长达两卷的报告《临近死亡：完善临终护理》。报告确定了医院临终关怀护理中存在的两个问题：对病痛处理不力和大胆使用“无效而强制性的医疗程序”，这些程序可能会延长死亡期，甚至会让病人临终时痛苦不堪。（长难句③）
医疗行业正在采取措施，让年轻医生去晚期病人休养所培训，测试各种大胆的镇痛疗法方面的知识，为医院护理制定一份医疗保障制度的条例，以及制定新的标准来评估和治疗病人的临终痛苦。（佳句②）
安纳斯说，在坚持让善意的医疗动机转化成更好的护理方面，律师可以发挥关键作用。“不少医生对病人不必遭受的、可预见的痛苦无动于衷”，甚至构成“蓄意虐待病人”。（长难句④）他说，行医执照颁发机构“必须明确表明――病人痛苦地死亡可以被认为是由于医生治疗不当造成的，应当吊销其行医执照”。

翻译试题解析


一、试题总体分析
本文主要讲的是行为科学的建立。人类的行为问题只能由行为科学去解决，然而行为科学发展缓慢，部分原因是传统意义上的行为科学多数情况下还是从心态等方面而不是从环境中寻找行为的根源，环境的重要作用刚刚被承认并开始成为研究对象，而传统理解又根深蒂固，只有当这些问题得以解决之后，行为科学才能得以发展。
与往年相同，本年度的翻译试题首先要求考生进行语法分析，梳理句子结构。2002年试题的句子结构并不十分复杂，但是翻译时需要小心谨慎，因为里面有一些词汇的意思不是考生在词汇表中记忆的词义，而需要根据上下文，做出相应的调整，才能确定在本上下文中搭配恰当的词义，如果仅停留在英汉词义对译的层面上，译出的句子肯定比较生硬蹩脚，有时甚至不知所云。通过对考生试卷的抽查，发现部分考生对词汇的掌握仅停留在英汉词义对译的层次；语法分析能力差，句子结构梳理不清；有些英文句子理解到了，但由于中文表达能力非常有限，结果翻译出来的句子逻辑混乱，自然得分很低。因此，考生如果要想翻译得高分，应培养好扎实的语言（中、英文）基本功。

二、试题具体解析
（41）One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on.
   [解析]  本题考核的知识点是：词义选择、固定搭配trace … to …、表语从句。
这是一个简单句，主干为：One difficulty is that …。that引导的表语从句中主语all由一个of引导名词性从句 what is called behavioral science 修饰；谓语是continues；最后的states of mind, feelings...and so on 都是做trace…to…中介词to的宾语。
词汇：what is called behavioral science在句中不能译为“被称为行为的科学”；continue to原意为“继续…”，但是此处译成“继续”不特别贴切，在这里的意思其实是“仍然，依然”，动词应译成副词；trace 做动词，trace sth.（back）to sth.的意思是find the origin of sth.“找到…的根源”为固定搭配。state of mind 意为“心态”；trait意为“特征”；human nature 意为“人性”。
译文：难题之一在于所谓的行为科学几乎全都依然从心态、情感、性格特征、人性等方面去寻找行为的根源。
（42）The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find.
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：形容词带不定式、对仗结构、被动语态的译法。
这是一个主从复合句，句子主干为The behavioral sciences have been slow to … partly because… and partly because …。slow to change是形容词带不定式，译成“发展缓慢”。主句是由两个partly because形成对仗结构，都引导原因状语从句，可译作“部分原因是……”，“部分由于……”。两个状语从句都是被动语态，但都可译成主动语态。两个从句内容相互对照，可以对照理解：other kinds of explanations（其他的解释）是相对于前一从句中的the explanatory items（用来解释的依据）说的；directly observed （直接观察到）和hard to find（难以找到）意思上也基本相对。
词汇：the explanatory items直译是“解释性的项目”，但在这是指“解释行为的项目”，应该根据上下文需要补上“行为”这一层意思。
译文：行为科学之所以发展缓慢，部分原因是用来解释行为的依据似乎往往是直接观察到的，部分原因是其他的解释方式一直难以找到。
（43）The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied.
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：词义的引申、被动语态的译法。
这个句子是由and 连接的两个简单句构成的。前一个句子为被动语态，其主干是the role … was formulated…。the role由of...和in...两个介词短语修饰，only a little...ago是时间状语，汉语中状语的位置是主句之前或谓语动词之前。后一个句子主干为the selective role of … in … is only beginning to be …。主语role由形容词selective和of the environment in...individual修饰，in...表示“在…方面”。两个分句都是被动语态，但被动语态不一定全要译成“被”，因为中文许多情况下主动态可以表示被动。此外还有“得以……”，“为……所”等方法可以选择。
词汇：role的一个意思是“角色”，这里使用的是另外一个词义“作用”，两个句子的主语的结构都是the role of A in B，of 和in都修饰the role，意思是“A在B方面的作用”。formulate 的意思是to create sth. in a precise form（阐明）；a little more than a hundred years意为“一百多年”；shape 做动词的意思是“塑造”。
译文：自然选择在进化中的作用仅在一百多年前才得以阐明，而环境在塑造和保持个体行为时的选择作用则刚刚开始被认识和研究。
（44）They are the possessions of the autonomous （self-governing）man of traditional theory, and they are essential to practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements.
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：代词指代、定语从句的译法。
这是一个由and 连接的并列句。前一句中是主系表结构：They are the possessions of …；后一句也是主系表结构：they are essential to …。前一分句中考查主语指代问题，本题两个分句的主语都是they，它们的上文是：Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty。They是复数，因此可以推断它们不是指代difficulty，而是指代freedom和dignity。possessions意为“拥有的东西”，在这可转译成动词“拥有”。此处括号（self-governing）的作用是解释autonomous （自治的，自主的，自我管理的）这个词，两词意思基本一样，译时只用一个即可。
后一分句中，practices 由in which...achievements修饰。定语从句中是被动语态，主语是a person，谓语是is held...和 (is) given。按照汉语习惯，可以分别处理为：“一个人应该对自己的行为负责”和“一个人因…受到表扬、给予肯定”。
词汇： held不能翻译成“持、握”，它在这里是“认为”的意思。再如：Many people hold the opinion that the Government should take measures to stop terrorism.（许多人认为政府应当采取措施去制止恐怖主义），文中is held responsible for…可以意译为“要求一个人对……负责”；give credit for意为“因……而受到表扬”；practices的意思很多，如“练习，实践”等，在这里，它的意思是thing done regularly; habit or custom，即“习惯，做法”，在翻译中由于这些“做法”的具体内容的出现，“做法”这个词可以被省略。essential意为“对……必不可少”，即“是…的必要条件”，或“是…必不可少的前提”。
技巧：考研中经常考查代词指代，包括they，it，that，this等等。这些代词给理解造成了困难，是一个难点。其实这些代词基本上都不难在上下文中找到答案，它们基本上都指前文出现的某人或某物（this较为特殊，还可以指紧接的下文）。考生一般根据代词的单复数和题目的意思就可以找到指代对象。
译文：自由和尊严（它们）是传统理论定义的自主人拥有的，是要求一个人对自己的行为负责并因其业绩而给予肯定的必不可少的前提。
（45）Until these issues are resolved, a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our problems. 
[解析] 本题考核的知识点是：省略句、正面意思反面表达、代词指代。
本句是一个并列句，由and连接，前半句由于时间状语until提前，主句进行倒装。until意为“直到”，直译是“在这些问题得到解决之前，技术将继续……”，这种说法不符合中文习惯，它适合从反面表达：“如果这些问题得不到解决，技术将……”。注意被动语态are resolved按照汉语习惯可以译成“得到解决”。
and后是一省略句，其难点在于确定代词it的指代内容。it 经常指代前文的单数名词或不可数名词（词组），也经常指代前文的某件事情，某个情况。本文中就是最后一种用法，it指的就是前文a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected这件事情。
with做状语一般表示伴随。这一分句只有一个状语加一个名词结构，不成一个完整的句子。其实，省略句一般是与前句的相同成分才会被省略，前一句的谓语部分是：will continue to be rejected。所以后一分句补充完整是：with the rejection of the technology of behavior, the only way to solve our problem will continue to be rejected.。当然这里with it也可简单译为“随之”，但是只有真正了解句子之后才能正确翻译。
词汇：technology of behavior要根据文章内容适当加词，译为“研究行为的技术手段”。
译文：（如果）这些问题得不到解决，研究行为的技术手段就会继续受到排斥，解决问题的惟一方式可能也随之继续受到排斥。


三、参考译文
几乎我们所有的问题都涉及到人类行为，这些问题不能单纯依靠物理学和生物技术就得以解决。我们需要的是一门行为技术，但是发展行为技术需要科学为基础，在这方面，我们一直滞后。（41）难题之一在于所谓的行为科学几乎全都依然从心态、情感、性格特征、人性等方面去寻找行为的根源。物理学和生物学一度使用类似的方法，而且当它们放弃这些方法后才得以向前发展。（42）行为科学之所以发展缓慢，部分原因是用来解释行为的依据似乎往往是直接观察到的，部分原因是其他的解释方式一直难以找到。环境固然重要，但是它的作用依然不很清楚。环境并不起强迫或促进的作用，它进行的是选择，这种功能发现和分析起来都很困难。（43）自然选择在进化中的作用仅在一百多年前才得以阐明，而环境在塑造和保持个体行为时的选择作用则刚刚开始被认识和研究。然而，随着有机体和环境之间的相互作用逐渐为人们所了解，一度被认为是由思维、感情、性格产生的影响现在被追溯到人们可以理解的环境上去了，因而，建立行为技术也就成为了可能。然而，除非行为技术取代科学出现之前形成的传统观念，否则它无法解决我们的问题，而这些传统观念已经根深蒂固。自由和尊严就能说明困难程度。（44）它们是传统理论定义的自主人拥有的，是要求一个人对自己的行为负责并因其业绩而给予肯定的必不可少的前提。科学分析把中心从责任和成就转向了环境。这也引发了关于“价值”的问题。谁来使用这一技术，又要达到何种目的？
（45）（如果）这些问题得不到解决，研究行为的技术手段就会继续受到排斥，解决问题的惟一方式可能也随之继续受到排斥。


第三部分   写作试题解析


一、审题谋篇
 	本题为图画，是命题加提纲式写作。
与往年的图画加提纲式写作相比，2002年考题给出了题目“Cultures―National and International”。对于考生这是不应忽略的审题重点之一。首先，由题目可看出，本文关键字为“文化”，修饰词为“National”和“International”再加上图片的标题是“An American Girl in Traditional Chinese Costume”，由此可以得出本文的立意应该是文化交流。这种交流反映了两方面的情况：一方面是中国文化对世界文化的渗透，中国源远流长的文化本身是世界文化财产的一部分，中国的腾飞无疑使中国文化这颗世界文化中的瑰宝更加耀眼。另一方面是世界对中国文化的了解与接受。瑰宝自然是吸引人的，世界人民渴望了解中国。由此，当外国人身着中式服装，体验中国文化时，那种欣喜与满意自然也在情理之中。
另外，事实上，考研的考题通常是有着某种社会意义的。2001年中国发生的几件大事确实使世界对中国刮目相看，如奥运申办成功，中国加入世界贸易组织等。这些确实加强了世界了解中国的渴望。加之中国经济腾飞，中国要走出去，外国要走进来，这种国际间的交流已成定局。有了以上想法，作文中心就已确定。
  	文章可以遵循大纲写成两段，也可以分为三段。第一段描写图画并指出图画所反映的现象，即：中国文化被许多外国人接受和认可。第二段主要对这一现象做出评论，可以集中于讨论这种现象产生的原因。在这一段中，可以用一些表示“导致、引起”意思的词汇，例如： “bring about, give rise to, cause, lead to, bring forth, make happen”等等。考生可以根据实际情况决定是否增加一个第三段，该段属于发挥，写法考生应该比较熟悉，既可以谈自己的看法，也可预测一下这种现象将来发展的趋势。

二、参考范文
Cultures―National and International
	This unique picture shows an American girl in traditional Chinese costume. The jeweled headdress，beaded necklace and earrings with tassels，and silk attire with ribbons characterize the traditional costume of Chinese minority nationality girls. The costume adds oriental charm to her beauty. Her radiant smile is as much a tribute to Chinese culture as to the progress China has recently made. Like this American girl who shows a special interest in Chinese costumes, more and more foreigners have begun to understand and accept the Chinese culture.  
	Obviously，we can deduce from this picture that with the development of China，the increasing charm of Chinese tradition appeals to more and more foreigners who come to China. On the one hand，it highlights the glamour of our culture―now universally accepted as the invaluable treasure of all human beings. Attracted by the splendid Chinese culture，now many a foreigner floods into China to study or to work. On the other hand，it reflects our great achievements. When China was then engulfed in poverty，backwardness，corruption and foreign invasion，who cared about the culture associated with the pigtailed coolies? But during the last two decades one can hardly ignore the rapid progress of China. Three months after China won the right to host their first Olympics in 2008，China capped the most significant year in its sporting history when the national soccer team reached the World Cup finals for the first time. How can one resist being appealed to such an energetic country with a long and colorful culture!
It goes without saying that culture exchange does good to people in many ways. Firstly, it effectively reduces the misunderstanding between people from different cultures. Moreover, this kind exchange has mutual benefits to people from different cultures because it enables them to learn from each other. As a result, culture exchange has become more and more common in our life.

三、范文点评
文章结构：
从结构上看，范文首先对提纲做出适当调整，分为三段。每段段首出现主题句，点明该段主要思想，每段内部层次清晰。第一段段首为该段主题句，中间对图画进行描写，段尾从图画中得出全文的主题。第二段段首为该段主题句，进而用On the one hand 和On the other hand 分两个方面进行论证。第三段是进一步的发挥，段首提出作者观点，并在段尾对全文做出总结。
语言亮点：
1. jeweled：“镶珠宝的”，与下面的beaded（珠子串成的）属于同一种用法，为名词加ed构成形容词。类似的用法还有：bearded有胡须的，haired有毛发的，windowed有窗的。
2. characterize：“是…的特点；以…为特征”。例如：High GDP increase rate characterizes the overall economic development of China in the past ten years.（国内生产总值高增长率是过去十年中国整体经济发展的特点）。
3. minority nationality：“少数民族”。
4. oriental：“东方的”。例如：The Oriental Pearl Tower（东方明珠电视塔）；Shanghai is an oriental metropolis（上海是一个东方大都会）。
5. radiant：“容光焕发的，喜气洋洋的”，例如：The bride was radiant (with joy). 她（因高兴）而精神焕发。
6. as much a tribute to Chinese culture as to the progress：as much … as…“和…一样，如同…”。例如：Protecting the environment is as much the government’s responsibility as every citizen’s duty.（保护环境既是政府的职责，同样也是每个公民的责任）。tribute to意思为“对…的称赞”。
7. deduce：推论，可替换的词语还有：conclude。
8. appeal to：“向…上诉”或“吸引”。例如：Video games are increasingly appealing to teenagers.（电子游戏越来越吸引青少年）。
9. highlight：“使…显著，使…突出；强调…”。例如：Growing economic problems were highlighted by a slowdown in oil output.（石油产量的下降使日益增加的经济困难更加突出了）。
10. universally：“普遍”。如：It is a universally accepted principle that …。
11. invaluable treasure：“无价之宝”。例如：Health is an invaluable blessing.（健康是无价之宝）。
12. many a foreigner：“很多外国人”。many a加名词单数相当于该名词的复数形式，是古英语的遗留痕迹。
13. flood into：“涌入”。例如：Many migrant workers flood into cities.（很多农民工涌入城市）。类似能够表达“大量而来”含义的还有：swarm into（蜂拥而入），pour into（如潮水般涌入）flow into，rush into等。如：Hundreds of people rush into cities，especially big cities．They come for better jobs and better education，for better medical care，and for commerce and trade.（成百上千的人涌入城市尤其是大城市里，为了得到更好的工作或教育，得到更好的医疗保健，也为了开展商业贸易活动）。
14. engulf：“吞没，淹没”，如：An almost unbearable loneliness engulfed her.（她陷入了一种几乎难以忍耐的寂寞）。类似含义的词有：overwhelm，submerge，immerse等，如：The whole nation was immersed in a festival atmosphere.（全国沉浸在节日的气氛中）。
15. care about：“在乎，在意”。
16. be associated with：“与…连在一起”。例如：Many foreigners still associate China with backwardness.（很多外国人还把中国和落后连在一起）。
17. host：“举办”，近义词为sponsor, stage。
18. cap：“完成，使圆满结束”，如：This week’s summit capped months of intensive negotiations between the two governments.（这个星期的最高级会议圆满结束了两国政府间几个月来深入细致的谈判）。

四、写作误区
篇章结构误区：
在对图画描述部分，考生存在两个极端。一是描述非常简单，只是一句话代过，例如This is an American girl in traditional Chinese costume.，接着就开始发表议论。这样的问题出现很可能是考生词汇量太小，写作功底太薄，面对这样一个图片形式的描述无从下笔。有些考生也只写出了几个简单句子，如：The girl is laughing. The girl is wearing beautiful hat and clothes. She is happy. 另一个极端是局限于画面的具体内容，就事论事，用很大的篇幅来描写画面中服饰的细节。实际上在适当的描述后考生应当展开主题，按照题目的要求从“文化”这一概念入手。同样，文章也不应当写成中美或中西文化的对比。
语言表达错误： 
①用词错误：
We should develop China’s economic, and lead our country to a rich, strong nation.（We should develop China’s economy, and make our country thriving and prosperous）
②主谓搭配：
The picture shows an American girl who wearing the traditional Chinese costume.（The picture shows an American girl who wears the traditional Chinese costume.）
③句子不完整：
The importance of cultural communication just to let more foreigners know China.（The cultural communication is to let more foreigners know China.）
④不间断句子：
China opened the door to the world, more and more people visit China and become interested in Chinese culture. (As China opened the door to the world, more and more people visit China and become interested in Chinese culture.)
⑤句子结构混乱：
The way of people to do things will become similar if they communicate more with people belong to other cultures.（The way in which people do things will become similar if they communicate more with people who belong to other cultures.）
⑥中式英语：
The girl very likes Chinese culture.（The girl likes Chinese culture very much.）
