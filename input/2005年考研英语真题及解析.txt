The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals, this is largely because, animals, we stand upright. This means that our noses are to perceiving those smells which float through the air, the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact, , we are extremely sensitive to smells, we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of human smells even when these are to far below one part in one million.
Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another, others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell can suddenly become sensitive to it when to it often enough.
The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it to keep all smell receptors working all the time but can new receptors if necessary. This may explain why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells―we simply do not need to be. We are not of the usual smell of our own house, but we new smells when we visit someone else’s. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors for unfamiliar and emergency signals the smell of smoke, which might indicate the danger of fire.

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human,” with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services” than males.
Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan’s and Dr. de Waal’s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.
In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.
21. In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.
[A] posing a contrast          [B] justifying an assumption
[C] making a comparison        [D] explaining a phenomenon
22. The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that ________.
[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals
[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature
[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other
[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions
23. Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are ________.
[A] more inclined to weigh what they get
[B] attentive to researchers’ instructions
[C] nice in both appearance and temperament
[D] more generous than their male companions
24. Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys ________.
[A] prefer grapes to cucumbers
[B] can be taught to exchange things
[C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated
[D] are unhappy when separated from others
25. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.
[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.
[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.
[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn’t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth’s atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel’s report: “Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.”
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it’s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it’s obvious that a majority of the president’s advisers still don’t take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of “paralysis by analysis.”
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won’t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.
26. An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________.
[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death
[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant
[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life
[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense
27. According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as ________.
[A] a protector   [B] a judge   [C] a critic  [D] a guide
28. What does the author mean by “paralysis by analysis” (Last line, Paragraph 4)?
[A] Endless studies kill action.
[B] Careful investigation reveals truth.
[C] Prudent planning hinders progress.
[D] Extensive research helps decision-making.
29. According to the author, what should the Administration do about global warming?
[A] Offer aid to build cleaner power plants.
[B] Raise public awareness of conservation.
[C] Press for further scientific research.
[D] Take some legislative measures.
30. The author associates the issue of global warming with that of smoking because ________.
[A] they both suffered from the government’s negligence
[B] a lesson from the latter is applicable to the former
[C] the outcome of the latter aggravates the former
[D] both of them have turned from bad to worse

Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” -- the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the “emotional brain”) is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events -- until, it appears, we begin to dream.
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or “we wake up in a panic,” Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or rather dream -- on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.
31. Researchers have come to believe that dreams ________.
[A] can be modified in their courses
[B] are susceptible to emotional changes
[C] reflect our innermost desires and fears
[D] are a random outcome of neural repairs
32. By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show ________.
[A] its function in our dreams
[B] the mechanism of REM sleep
[C] the relation of dreams to emotions
[D] its difference from the prefrontal cortex
33. The negative feelings generated during the day tend to ________.
[A] aggravate in our unconscious mind
[B] develop into happy dreams
[C] persist till the time we fall asleep
[D] show up in dreams early at night
34. Cartwright seems to suggest that ________.
[A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams
[B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control
[C] dreams should be left to their natural progression
[D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious
35. What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have bad dreams?
[A] Lead your life as usual.
[B] Seek professional help.
[C] Exercise conscious control.
[D] Avoid anxiety in the daytime.
Text 4
Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.
Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom,” for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing,” has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.
Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.
Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china.” A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
36. According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.
[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms
[B] is but all too natural in language development
[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture
[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s
37. The word “talking” (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________.
[A] modesty  [B] personality  [C] liveliness  [D] informality
38. To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely agree?
[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.
[B] Black English can be more expressive than standard English.
[C] Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.
[D] Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas.
39. The description of Russians’ love of memorizing poetry shows the author’s ________.
[A] interest in their language    [B] appreciation of their efforts
[C] admiration for their memory   [D] contempt for their old-fashionedness
40. According to the last paragraph, “paper plates” is to “china” as ________.
[A] “temporary” is to “permanent”  [B] “radical” is to “conservative”
[C] “functional” is to “artistic”  [D] “humble” is to “noble”

Canada’s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.
They’re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-growing component of which are pharmaceutical costs.
41. ________
What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care -- to say nothing of reports from other experts -- recommended the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and create a national institution.
42. ________
But “national” doesn’t have to mean that. “National” could mean interprovincial -- provinces combining efforts to create one body.
Either way, one benefit of a “national” organization would be to negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province -- or a series of hospitals within a province -- negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.
Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.
43. ________
A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.
A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, strings attached. That’s one reason why the idea of a national list hasn’t gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.
44. ________
Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow’s report selectively, especially the parts about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: “A national drug agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.”
45. ________
So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their budgets and patients.
[A] Quebec’s resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec’s Drug Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 26.8 per cent!
[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby’s report: “the substantial buying power of such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.”
[C] What does “national” mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.
[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will continue to increase faster than government revenues.
[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.
[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.
[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn’t like a national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly significant phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one’s impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.
Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 48) This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 1989.
Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.
49) Creating a “European identity” that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice -- that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no exaggeration to say “United we stand, divided we fall” -- and if I had to choose a slogan it would be “Unity in our diversity.” A unity of objectives that nonetheless respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

A Helpless Father
The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father’s negligent children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father “roll into” their households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.
Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children’s decent dressing, but their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse, they discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer care for their elders, let alone their neighbors or the disadvantaged; instead they try every means to avoid responsibility for other citizens. When one cares for others, one might even appear stupid or may even be distrusted.
Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of giving help and love the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to our government to establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on the face.

1.	C 空格前讲的是，和动物相比，人的嗅觉常被认为不灵敏，空格后讲的是，…这主要是因为，…动物，我们是直立的。由本段首句"人的鼻子是一个被低估的工具"可知，作者并不认同"人的嗅觉没有动物的灵敏"这一有关人类嗅觉的常规观点。由此可推知，空格前后部分存在隐形的转折关系，即作者并不认为人的鼻子不灵敏，只不过因为人是直立的，故正确答案为C项。 
2.	B 空格所在部分讲的是，这主要是因为，…动物，我们是直立的。因人类是直立的，而动物不是直立的。由此可知，空格处所填单词应表示对比含义，unlike意为"与…不同"，符合文意，故选B。 
3.	A 空格所在部分讲这意味着我们的鼻子…感知在空气中飘过的气味。由上句可知，和动物不同，人类是直立的，由此可知，人的鼻子只能感知在空气中飘过的气味。因此，空格处应填表示"局限"的词。limit和confine都表示"局限"，但confine意为"限制"，表示限制在一定活动、领域、地域内。limit意为"局限于"，表示时间、空间、程度、数量等方面所能或允许达到的最大程度，符合文意，故选A。 
4. C 空格所在部分讲的是，…大多数紧贴地面的气味。由上文可知，和动物不同，人类是直立的，人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味。由此可知，人类"不能感知"大多数紧贴地面的气味。catch意为"捕捉"，track意为"追踪"，显然都不符合文意。ignore意为主观上"忽视"，文中并没有体现人们故意忽视地面上的气味，因此，不符合文意。miss意为"错过，未察觉"，符合文意，即人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味，"未能察觉到"大多数紧贴地面的气味。
5.	B 空格所在部分讲的是，事实上,…，我们对气味非常敏感。由上文可知，人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味，而遗漏了大多数紧贴地面的气味。由此可知空格所在部分和上文间为转折关系。though作副词时，意为"可是"，符合文意，故选B项。 
6. A 空格所在句讲的是，然而，实际上，我们对气味非常敏感，…我们通常意识不到这一点。显然，空格前后为让步关系，even if意为"即使"，符合文意，故选A。 
7. D 空格所在部分讲的是，我们的鼻子能够…人类的气味。由此可知，空格处需填入一个动词，和后面的"人类的气味"构成动宾搭配。distinguish意为"区分，辨别"，常表示"人通过看、听的感官来识别事物"，discover意为"（第一个）发现"，determine意为"查明，测定"，显然，这三项均不符合文意。detect意为"查明，察觉"，符合文意，即"我们的鼻子能够觉察人类的气味"，故选D。 
8.	A 空格所在句讲即使这些气味被…到百万分之一以下。dissolve意为"溶解"，disperse意为"分散"，diffuse意为"使分散"，这三项均不能修饰human smells。dilute意为"稀释"，合文意，即"我们的鼻子能够觉察人类的气味，即使这些气味被稀释到百万分之一以下"，故选A。 
9. D 空格所在句的含义为"奇怪的是，一些人发现他们能闻到一种花的气味却闻不到另一种，…另一些人对这两种花的气味同样敏感"。显然，空格前后为对比关系，whereas意为"然而，但是"，用于比较或对比两个事实，符合文意，故正确答案为D项。 
10. B 空格所在句的含义为"这可能是因为有些人不具备必要的基因在鼻子里产生…的气味接收器"。由文意可知，这句话是对上一句话的解释，即一些人闻不到另一种花的气味是因为他们不具备必要的基因在鼻子里产生…的气味接收器。由此可推知，这种气味接收器是"特定的"，故选B项。
11.	C 空格所在句的含义为"这些气味接收器是一些细胞，它们感知到气味，并向大脑发送…。""向大脑发送信号"符合逻辑与文意，故正确答案为C项。 
12.	A 空格所在句讲的是，但是，研究发现，即使是对某种气味不敏感的人…，如果经常…这种气味，也会突然变得对它敏感起来。由此可知，本句是讲人对气味的敏感在某种条件下可以改变。因此可推知，"之前"，人对这种气味是不敏感的。at first意为"起初，起先"，符合逻辑与文意，故选A。 
13. D 空格所在部分省略了主语people和be动词，讲的是人对某种气味由"不敏感"变得"敏感"的条件。由此可推知，人只有经常"闻到"这种气味，才会对它变得敏感，be exposed to意为"暴露于"，符合文意，即"如果经常接触这种气味"，故正确答案为D项。 
14.	C 空格所在部分讲嗅觉不敏感的原因可能是因为大脑觉得，使所有气味接收器一直工作…，考生需判断"所有气味接收器一直工作"的后果。incompetent意为"无能力的，不胜任的"，主语一般是人，因此不合文意。另外，所有气味接收器一直工作也不会"没效果"或"不充分"，因此，A和D也不符合文意。inefficient意为"效率低的"，符合文意，即"所有气味接收器一直工作效率不高"，故选C。 
15.	D 空格所在部分讲的是，但是在需要时，大脑可以…新的气味接收器。由上文可知，大脑不让所有的气味接收器一直工作，因为那样的效率很低。由but可知，空格所在部分和上文构成转折关系，因此，空格处所填单词应有"使气味接收器工作"的含义。summon意为"召唤"，主语一般是人，因此不符合文意。另外，大脑也不可能"推行"或是"引起"新的气味接收器，因此，选项A和C也不符合文意。create意为"创造；创作"，符合文意，即"但是在需要时，大脑可以创建新的气味接收器"，故选D。 
16.	B 空格所在句讲这可以…解释为什么我们总是对自己的气味不敏感--只是不需要而已。由文意可知，其中"this"指代上一句提到的大脑工作的原理，即"大脑觉得，使所有气味接收器一直工作效率低下"。由此可知，和上一句提到的"嗅觉不敏感的原因"一样，"我们总是对自己的气味不敏感"的原因也能用大脑的这个工作原理来解释。因此，空格所在句和上句为并列关系，also意为"也"，符合文意。 
17.	C 空格所在部分讲的是，我们不会…自己家里的气味。由上文可知，我们总是对自己的气味不敏感，由此可推知，我们对熟悉的气味不敏感，故我们对自己家里的气味也会"不敏感"。be aware of意为"察觉到，发觉"，符合文意，故正确答案为C项。 
18.	D 空格所在部分讲的是，我们察觉不到自己家里惯有的气味，但是当我们拜访其他人的家时，就会…新的气味。由"但是"可知，这两句之间为转折关系，因此，空格处所填单词的含义应与"察觉不到"相反。notice意为"意识到"，符合文意，故选D项。 
19.	A 空格所在部分讲的是，大脑发现最好让气味接收器…以便捕捉不熟悉和紧急的信号，此处for表示对象。由此可知，气味接收器只有是"可使用的"，而不是"可靠的"、"可辨认的"或是"合适的"，才能捕捉不熟悉和紧急的信号，故正确答案为A项。 
20.	B 空格前讲"不熟悉和紧急的信号"，空格后讲"可能意味着有火险的烟味"。"可能意味着有火险的烟味"是"紧急的信号"的一种。由此可知空格前后为例证关系，故选B。

21. C 细节事实题。根据第一段第④⑤句可知，不公平意识被认为是"人之常情"，其潜在的假定是其他动物不可能具有如此细腻的不公平意识。然而一项研究表明，这也是"猴之常情"。由此可知，作者在第一段中"通过将人类和猴子进行对比的方式"，引出动物间不公平意识这一话题，comparison一词主要强调比较事物之间的相同之处，故选C项。
22. B 推理判断题。根据第一段第④⑤句可知，这种表现被认为是"人之常情"，其潜在的假定是其他动物不可能具有如此细腻的不公平意识。接着作者进行转折指出，"然而"一项研究表明，这也是"all too monkey"，由此可知，作者认为猴子之间也具有这种"不公平意识"，故选B项。
23. A 细节事实题。根据第二段第④句可知，最重要的是，就象人类女性一样，雌性僧帽猴往往比雄性更加关注"商品和服务"的价值。由此可知，雌僧帽猴被选来作研究最主要的原因是它们"更加倾向于注重它们所得的东西"，故选A项。
24. C 细节事实题。根据第五段第③句可知，只有当每只猴子感到自己未受欺骗时，这种合作才得以维持。由此可知，猴子们"如果感到被欺骗就不会合作"，故选C项。
25. B 推理判断题。据第五段第⑥句可知，这种公平感是在僧帽猴和人类身上各自独立进化而成，还是源自三千五百万年前他们共同的祖先，仍是个"待解决"问题。由此可知，人类愤怒的来源不得而知。
Text 2
26. C 推理判断题。根据第一段第③句可知，作者提问，是否还记得怀疑者们坚持认为"禁烟的游说想毁掉我们的生活方式"，而政府应当置身事外的时候呢？由此可以推知，该问题的隐含之意是吸烟的支持者们认为人们"有选择自己的生活方式的自由"，所以关于"禁烟"的游说就是要"毁掉人们的生活方式"，故选C项。
27. D 细节事实题。根据第二段第⑤句提到的艾伯特的观点可知，科学确实能够为我们的未来"提供有效的指引"，关键是我们的国家和整个世界在制定重要决策时，都应以科学能够提供的关于人类现在的行为对未来影响的最佳判断为依据。由此可知，艾伯特认为科学可以作为"引导者"，故选D项。
28. A 猜测词义题。根据第四段第③句可知，他们（指美国政府）"没有出台任何行动计划"，反而"只是继续迫切要求进行更多的研究"--这是一个典型的"分析导致麻痹"的例子。由此可知，作者认为不断的分析研究会扼杀行动，故选A项。
29. D 细节事实题。根据第五段第③句可知，倘若政府不争取立法上的主动权，国会就应当帮助政府开始制定保护措施。由此可知，作者认为政府应当争取立法的主动权，即采取一些法律措施来应对全球变暖，故选D项。
30. B 推理判断题。根据第二段的内容，作者将"吸烟问题"与"全球变暖"进行了对比，指出有的人认为全球变暖的证据不够充分而对其表示怀疑。第三段时作者进一步指出，等有充分证据来证明全球变暖时，一切都太迟了。由此可知，作者认为人们从吸烟问题中吸取的教训（即人们应当及时采取措施，而不是坚持认为证据尚不充分）同样适用于全球变暖问题，故选B项。

31. A 细节事实题。根据第一段第⑤⑥⑦句提到的研究人员的观点可知，一名著名权威人士提到，梦这种异常强烈的精神活动还"可以被我们有意识地控制"。卡特赖特说"梦是你自己的，如果不喜欢，就改变它"。由以上几点可知，研究人员认为，梦在形成过程中"能够被改变"，故选A项。
32. C推理判断题。根据第二段第①句可知，作者指出"大脑造影的证据支持了上述观点"，"上述观点"即首段中提到的观点，作者认为"梦是大脑情感自动调温器的一部分，可对情绪进行调节"。作者在第二段第③句提到了"边缘系统"也是在详细描述"大脑造影的证据"。由以上几点可以推知，作者通过提到大脑的边缘系统，描述了"大脑造影的证据"，从而说明其支持"梦与情感相联系"的观点，故选C。
33. D细节事实题。根据第三段第②句可知，多数人似乎"在晚上入睡不久后做较多噩梦"，而在睡醒之前会逐渐做一些开心的梦，这表明人们在梦里"逐渐消除了白天的不良情绪"。由此可知，白天期间产生的负面情绪往往"出现在夜晚早期的梦中"，故选D项。
34. D 推理判断题。根据第四段第①句，这一过程（指做梦）"未必是无意识的"。由此可以推知，作者认为"做梦可能不完全属于无意识行为"，故选D项。
35. A 推理判断题。根据第五段卡特赖特的观点，在一天结束时，只要梦不使我们睡不着或"从梦中惊醒"，就无需去在意它。本段最后也提到"对于那些没有长期受到噩梦困扰的人，安心睡觉--或者做梦，早上醒来时你将会感觉好多了"。由此可以推知，卡特赖特暗示人们只需要"像往常一样生活"。

36. B 细节事实题。根据第二段第②句可知，麦克沃特先生擅长的学术领域是语言史以及语言演变。他认为诸如"whom"这个正式英语词汇的逐渐消失是"自然的"，并不比古英语中尾格的消失更让人遗憾。由此可知，麦克沃特认为正式英语的退化只不过是语言发展中的自然现象，故选B项。
37. D 猜测词义题。根据第三段第①句可知，"走自己的路"这一对事物真实性和个人性的崇高信条，已经使正式演讲、写作、诗歌及音乐的消亡了"，即正式英语已经在退化了。第三段第④句指出，无论作为口语的英语还是书面语的英语，talking要胜过speaking，spontaneity（即兴发挥）也要胜过craft（精心准备）。由此可知，talking与speaking的对比就类似于spontaneity和craft的对比，"即兴发挥"代表使用非正式的语言，"精心准备"代表使用正式的语言。因此talking与speaking的对比也就是非正式英语和正式英语的对比，talking代表的就是非正式英语，故选D项。
38. A 细节事实题。根据第四段第④句可知，麦克沃特先生并不认为"我们说话方式不再规范就会影响我们去准确地思考"。换言之，麦克沃特先生认为"逻辑思维同我们的说话方式无必然联系"，选A。
39. B 观点态度题。根据第五段的内容，作者首先描述了俄罗斯人爱好背诵诗歌以及意大利的政客们倾向于精心准备演讲。作者举例的目的就是为了说明下文的观点，即"麦克沃特为那些虽不实用却很美好的事物的消逝而哀叹"。由此可知，在作者的眼里，"俄罗斯人爱好背诵诗歌"和"意大利的政客精心准备演讲"都属于"虽不实用却很美好的事物"。由此可以推知，作者对俄罗斯人的做法持欣赏态度，所以才表达出对美好事物正在消逝的哀叹，故选B项。
40. C 推理判断题。根据第五段第②③句可知，麦克沃特先生认为"正式英语"并非不可或缺，他也未提出要对教育进行彻底改革--其实他只是为那些"虽不实用却很美好的事物"的消逝而哀叹，如今我们用"纸盘子"而非"瓷盘子"来装我们的英语大餐。这可能是件惭愧的事情，但已经无法避免。由此可知，作者用"纸盘子"和"瓷盘子"来比喻正式英语的退化，联系上文可以推知，"纸盘子"指的是那些"实用却不美好"的事物，即非正式英语，"瓷盘子"则是指那些"不实用却美好"的事物，即正式英语，故选C。
Part B
41．E 因果关系。空格前面提到加拿大各省官员都在抱怨医疗预算的飞涨，尤其是药品费用的不断增长。空格后面的内容则由"what to do"引出下文对此问题的解决办法。可以看出两段内容衔接紧密，因此空白处的内容也须和"药品费用"有关。浏览各选项，只有E选项提到了"药品费用"，包括药品价格上涨的幅度和具体表现，恰好为上一段提到的"药费"上涨提供了依据，构成因果逻辑关系。
42．C 转折关系。空格前面提到建立国家药物管理机构，空格后面则以"but"引出了转折，说"国家"不一定指那个意思，接下来就表述了它的一个概念，即各省联合起来成立的一个机构。可知，空白处的内容应是对"国家"的一个解释，而代词"that"即指代这一概念。
43．G 顺接关系。空格前面谈到成立国家机构来争取降低药品的价格，如从经济学角度讲，潜在客户群越大，获得优惠价格的可能性就越大。空后讲到成立国家代理机构后取得的一项小突破。据上下文逻辑关系推断，空白处内容也应围绕成立国家代理机构而展开。浏览各选项，提到"national agency" 或同义词的有A, B, G，而对于B项中出现的指代词"they", 无法从上文中找到所指代的相应名词，所以排除。A项最易误选，因为它和上文都提到了专有名词Quebec, 但其内容主要是魁北克地方保护主义的表现和药品上涨的情况，与前后内容不衔接，因此不对。G选项涉及医药公司对设立国家药物机构的反应，表明其成立具有现实可能性，与下文所取得的进展存在着内容与逻辑上的一致性。
44．F 顺接关系。空格前面讲到某些省对联邦政府和省政府之间的交易持怀疑态度，空格后则指出这些省长们应该读读报告中有关药品的论述，了解成立国家药物机构的好处。可以推断，空白处内容要么是继续讨论来自这些省份的阻力，即承上；要么是建议他们更多了解成立国家机构的意义，即启下。符合条件的有B和F两项，但由于B项开头的并列连词 "or" 使其无法与上文衔接，因此不对。F项虽然把上文的关键词"premiers"换成了"provinces", 但其内容还是建议各省实现全国药物代理机构的功能，与上下文内容逻辑关系紧密。
45．B 对照关系。空前指出省长们应该读读Romanow的报告，B项则提到读一读Kirby的报告，结构与上文类似，且还重复运用了关键词 "report", 即暗含两份报告存在意义上的相似或相反特征。另外，两个专有名词Mr. Romanow和Mr. Kirby都已在第四段中被提到，他们都提倡建立国家药物代理机构。
Part C
46. 考点：被动语态的翻译，技巧就是通常把英文的被动语态翻译成中文的主动语态，即翻译技巧中的语态转换翻译。这样可翻成这样“电视是制造和传播这种情绪的媒介（手段、方式）之一”。 下面的采分点是倒装句，把否定词放在句前，形成一个倒装。这句翻译要注意，要把整个的句子看懂，进行词性、语序的转换。把“从来也没有如此大的作用”放在句末。这也是翻译的一个转换技巧。 
译文：电视是创造和传递感情的手段之一。也许在此之前，就加强不同的民族和国家之间的联系而言，电视还从来没有像在最近的欧洲事件中起过如此大的作用。
47. 考点：前面几乎可以直译，“在欧洲就像在其他地方一样多媒体集团越来越成功了”。当然根据中文表达可把句子加以转换，译成“和其他地方一样，欧洲的多媒体集团越来越成熟”。下半句有个定语从句离主干的句子较远，在句末，但翻译时须提前。 
译文：多媒体集团在欧洲就像在其他地方一样越来越成功了。这些集团把相互关系密切的电视台、电台、报纸、杂志、出版社整合到了一起。
48.   考点：代词要依赖上下文内容，代词后有副词“alone”，“alone”译成“仅此一点”，“仅这一点就表明在电视行业里生存不那么容易”。此外“underlined”，考了它一个特殊意义 “强调；凸显” 。
译文：仅这一点就表明在电视行业不是一个容易生存的领域。这个事实通过统计数字一目了然，统计表明在80家欧洲电视网中1989年出现亏损的不少于50%。
49.   考点：嵌套式定语从句使主语的后置定语很长，翻译时需要先根据原句的次序梳理思路，再按照汉语的行文习惯，将后置的定语从句提前，放于被限定的名词之前翻译。
译文：创造一个尊重不同文化和传统的“欧洲统一体”绝非易事，需要战略性选择。正是这些文化和传统组成了连接欧洲大陆的纽带。
50.   考点：宾语从句为含有对称结构的两个并列分句，过去分词united和divided分别在两个分句中作条件状语。
译文：在应付一个如此规模的挑战过程中，我们可以毫不夸张地说，“团结，我们就会站起来；分裂，我们就会倒下去。”

05年小作文要求写一封辞职信。两个月前，你得到一份工作，担任设计与时尚杂志的编辑。但现在你发现工作并非想象中如意，所以决定辞职。写封信给老板王先生，告诉他你的决定，说明理由，表示歉意。首先要注意应用文的格式并准确理解提纲要求。另外应注意这几点：第一，这篇应用文中要避免写太空洞，当谈辞职时要说清楚背景，不能只说我要辞职，要谈辞职的准备时间、原因，你不能说我不适合这个工作，应再具体一点，比如举例说我不适应这个公司的工作强度、报酬方式等。第二，要注意辞职的语气，作为下级，对方是上级，在语气中一定要客气点。第三，安排好你的逻辑，先说辞职的过程，再谈辞职原因，最后谈你希望你能顺利此致，并对未来有展望。 
Part B
05年大作文是图画式作文。一般写三个段落，开头先描述图画，点名象征含义，第二段要分析这种现象产生的原因及未来发展的趋势，第三段要谈如何解决这个问题，并展望美好未来。应注意以下四点。第一，图画作文以小见大，要发觉图画的象征含义，中间是个很像足球的，破旧不堪的老人，上方是儿子，守门员，右上方是二儿子，右下方是三儿子，左上方是一个女儿，穿得很时髦，讲对老人的不孝敬，推脱赡养老人的义务，也可从正面说对老人应关怀。第二，注意在写现象的原因时，要注意逻辑层次和论证的严谨，可谈孝敬老人是中华民族的传统美德，还可以谈父母对我们的养育之恩。第三，中间部分突出赡养老人的重要性时，可采取对比修辞，关爱老人才会生活幸福，才能更好的关爱自己的社会；抛弃老人的子女连亲生父母都不要，怎么可以对社会有贡献呢？第四，在最后部分可以谈解决方案，一般是提高人的孝敬老人的觉悟，还有制订法律法规来保护老人的权利。
